> Our biggest reward as conference organizers is people doing great things with
something they learned at or with someone they met at the conference.

![The word why on a large screen at
JSConf](contents:images/cms/image-450df84c-1000.jpg)We are inviting the
JavaScript community to attend the upcoming JSConf EU (June 1-2 Berlin). For
ticket sales [watch our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jsconfeu) and
[purchase on ti.to](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019/).JSConf EU is a
professional, not-for-profit, labour-of-love conference for the JavaScript
community. It’s a two day affair, with many related side events in the days
surrounding it. JSConf EU is an invitation for the community to come together
and for new people to get to know and join the community.If you have a desire
to learn more about your profession or hobby and get energized about
JavaScript, then this conference is for you.The heart of the conference are
~45 presentations spread over two days with topics ranging from deep technical
journeys into JavaScript and what can be done with it to the big question of
why we are all doing this and how we could do it better.

This is rounded off with social events on the evenings before, the days of, and
the morning and midday after the conference. The socials are meant as a
conductor for people to have the chance to meet each other, discuss the topics
of the talks, and, above everything else, make real connections and maybe find
new friends.JSConf EU celebrates its host city Berlin. What better way to
invite all of Berlin to the event! The socials are open for the entire Berlin
tech community as well as the conference attendees. This allows the local
technology scene to meet all the great people (**you**!) who made their way to
Berlin and vice versa.## TopicsTo get a feel for the kind of talks you will
be able to see, here is the programme for the past years

![Foot at the event](contents:images/cms/image-28bd8dda-1000.jpg)A JSConf EU
ticket includes the following:- A wide range of refreshing drinks and
overflowing coffee including a barista making coffee on request.- Both days
include a full breakfast and lunch with delicious options for omnivores,
vegetarians, vegans, and people with celiac disease. If you have any special
dietary requirements, please let us know, so we can accommodate you.- On
Friday, we provide a full dinner for CSSconf attendees, before the social
event. The social event is open to all ticket holders.- On Sunday, the dinner
is on you, but we all meet again at the social event site, and we will host it
somewhere with a variety of street food and restaurant options nearby.- On
Monday, we provide a relaxing brunch with conference attendees who are on their
way back home. Conveniently located close to a transit hub, so getting to
trains and planes is a snap.


## Caring for Attendees

![A child at JSConf EU](contents:images/cms/image-62cf9bc9-1000.jpg)

Everybody is welcome at JSConf EU and to make sure everybody feels at home,
we’d like to point out that:- We provide a friendly, welcoming atmosphere for
you to have engaging conversations with people who share your interests.- We
aim to make the venue fully accessible. Fine print: Let us know if you have any
specific needs. We will refund your ticket if we cannot meet your needs.- We
offer **on-site childcare**.- We  have real-time captioning of talks to aid
the hearing impaired.- We can arrange for sign language interpreters on
request. Please let us know if you’d appreciate having an interpreter
available, so we can plan accordingly.- While this is a social event and
meeting people is a strong focus, we are equally welcoming to the more
introverted type of person who prefers to quietly see the talks. You can take a
breather by the riverside or in the grassy spaces nearby during the breaks.

## Previous experiences> “Awesome as usual!”> “An awesome way to spend a
weekend in Berlin!”> “The people, venue, and food made this the best
conference I have ever been to.”> “I felt completely welcomed by a tech
community that had a contagiously positive view about the world.”> “It was
encouraging to see so many women developers.”> “I was there previous year and
I know the unique atmosphere that JSConf EU has. I wouldn't miss it.”> “The
hosts were incredible, the catering was delicious and the talks were great.”

> “I really appreciate the ‘invisible’ touches that made the entire conference
smooth and hassle-free, like free food and a constant supply of free drinks,
the almost constant cleaning of the bathrooms, zero administrative overhead on
check-in.”> “This was probably one of the best weekends of my life, meeting
great people, listening to talented developers share their experiences with us
and getting inspired by a lot of them.”> “I most enjoyed the fact that I felt
completely included and taken care of by the conference and my peers.”
