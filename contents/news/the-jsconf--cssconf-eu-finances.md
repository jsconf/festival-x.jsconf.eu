JSConf & [CSSconf EU](https://2019.cssconf.eu/) are not-for-profit conferences.
But they also cost quite a bit of money to attend, with CSSconf starting at
€349 and JSConf starting at €699. We want to make transparent how this money is
used. So whether you are interested in attending one of our conferences, but
are not sure if we use your money wisely, __or__ if you want to run a major
conference yourself and wanted to see what kinds of things you’d need to plan
for, we thought: **Why not answer those questions by releasing our budget**.

A few words on what **not-for-profit** means in the context of these
conferences: The formal legal entity behind JSConf EU and CSSconf EU is
[__SinnerSchrader, a German digital agency__](https://sinnerschrader.com/),
which is a for-profit company. It backs up our finances and takes the risk of
running the events away from the personal finances of the organizing team
members. They **don’t assert editorial control** over the events (they do,
however, employ two of the core organizers for their full time jobs, but their
employer does not shape their work within the conferences). Having the company
backing allows us to really aim the budget at a net-€0, because we don’t have
to worry as much about losing money. We call this our __parachute sponsorship__
in case things don’t go as planned, and it has saved us from financial troubles
over and over again.

The conferences are run by an organizing team. These folks are volunteers and
organize the event in their free time. For some of them, their employers allow
doing some of the work during work time while others are freelancers and their
conference work is compensated out of their own pocket. The organizers receive
no monetary compensation for running the event whatsoever. In fact, some of
them come out at negative compensation by [contributing to the scholarship
program](https://2019.jsconf.eu/news/direct-support-for-our-scholarship-program/).
Our organising team has executive decision power and final say over any and all
parts of the event.

While the organizing team is not paid, a whole bunch of folks are paid in the
process of making sure the events actually happen. The very rough rule is “if
it is your job to put on events, then you are getting paid”. This is in
contrast to the volunteer team, who have day jobs and do not rely on the
conference for income. Since 2018, the conferences directly employ one full
time person, who primarily runs our sponsorship program. The production of the
event is done in collaboration with an event production agency called
[artribute](http://artribute.de/). The agency in turn employs a large number of
staff and subcontractors to perform the various duties needed to put on a
modern event, e.g. logistics, catering, security concept, fire safety concept,
hospitality services, event signage, setup and teardown. We also rely on a
variable number of volunteers on the days of the events. They also do not get
paid for their work, except with a full ticket to the event that includes all
possible perks.

## Venue and Custom Setup

![Our conference venue Arena
Berlin](contents:images/cms/image-9976c745-1000.jpg)

JSConf and CSSconf EU are different from many other conferences in that they
don’t happen in a standard conference venue or hotel. While such venues are
convenient for organisers in that they provide all the infrastructure
out-of-the-box and thus make the execution of events much simpler, they do not
allow for creating an experience with the accessibility and attention to detail
that we aspire to. Keep in mind that financial models for events happening in
conference hotels may be very different. That does not mean, however, that
they’d necessarily be cheaper. The extra simplicity for the organizers often
comes at a steep price.

## Taking Great Care of Everyone’s Experience

As another degree of differentiation, JSConf and CSSconf EU are elaborately
crafted experiences around numerous aspects: We fly in speakers from all over
the world, provide working WIFI, high quality video recordings, live
captioning, world-class vegetarian and vegan breakfast, lunch and dinner, free
and healthy drinks at all times, amazing coffee, professional child care and
run one of the most sophisticated [conference scholarship
programmes](/scholarships/) just to name a few things.

This is not the only way to run events. You can do it on a much smaller budget
with a lot fewer features. A couple of ways are by getting a free venue from
your local university, providing no or only simple food, and reducing the
production quality to the bare minimum. **We love these kinds of events**, and
we think there should be as many of them as possible. In fact, some of our
organisers __also__ organise low budget events like CSSclasses, upfront.ug and
have been instrumental in many other low-budget events in their local
communities in Berlin and Hamburg. That said, we do strongly feel that the
production fidelity of CSSconf and JSConf EU provide genuine value in bringing
the JavaScript and CSS communities together in a very unique and immersive
fashion and we strongly believe in a plurality of events of all types.

We also support a worldwide organisation of [CSSconf](http://cssconf.org/) and
[JSConf](https://jsconf.com/) families as well as adjacent and more local
events arounds the world, mentoring new conferences in new locations, helping
others with connections to speakers, sponsors, and even dealing with usually
hidden topics like problematic community members or companies.

## Supporting our Local and Sustainable Businesses

In addition to all of the above, we try hard to support local businesses when
putting up our event as much as possible to support the local community. We
also try very hard to avoid any one-time usage items like paper plates and opt
for reusable, and thus more expensive porcelain plates and cups, glass bottles,
and steel cutlery. One example is our collaboration with [SDW
Neukölln](http://sdw-neukoelln.de/): after years of ending the conference with
huge piles of leftover swag t-shirts, we decided to stop the waste, while still
offering the option to take home your conference t-shirt if you really want it.
SDW, a local community print workshop, now offers live printing in the
conference venue. Everyone can get a customized t-shirt and learn how it is
created at the same time. We have full control over the textiles being used
(i.e. we ensure they are all produced ethically and organically). Only shirts
that are requested get produced in the first place. Plus, we help a great local
community initiative to keep doing their great work!    

## Supporting Artists, Community & Open Source 

While our conference programmes already showcase a variety of topics ranging
from technical, social, professional to the artistic, we create spaces for
artists and open source communities to showcase their work in a professional
setting (Such as our [community
lounge](https://medium.com/the-codelog/jsconf-eu-community-lounge-7c27fb75b3a7)).
Our motto here is: if we bring this many people together, we want to make the
most of their experience by showing what Berlin has to offer in all sorts of
areas. This is also the reason why we open all of our social events to the
local community to attend, regardless of having a conference ticket.


# Budget Overview

**So, how much does it cost to put on JSConf and CSSconf EU?** Well, pretty
much exactly 1 million Euros in 2018. While our events have grown to over 1600
visitors, the actual cost per attendee has remained surprisingly stable over
the years (ticket prices have remained **unchanged for 6 years**). While bigger
events have economies of scale such as that the percentage of budget for
speaker travel goes down with an increasing attendee count, in our case this
evens itself out with increased cost for things like security and fire
protection in accordance with strict standards in Germany for major events.

![Pie chart of the major cost components. See below for textual
description](contents:images/cms/image-88ebd5c2.png)
The budget falls into the following categories:

- **Conf Production: 28%**. This is made up of costs directly related to the
conference such as speaker travel, hotel costs etc.
- **Venue & Event: 19.6%**. This is cost related to event production, for
example for AV equipment including cameras, microphones, projectors, mixing
consoles, cabling etc.
- **Location rental: 10.6%**. This is the rental cost for the event location,
beautiful [Arena Berlin](https://www.arena.berlin)
- **Furniture: 17.1%**. This is stuff like tables and chairs and the
scaffolding that we use to build the event.
- **Catering: 24.7%**. The food and drinks you consume at the event, this
breakfast, lunch and dinner. All exquisitely tasty, local, freshly made and
nutritious, with healthy drinks around the clock.

# FAQ

## What is scaffolding?

We’re talking literal scaffolding, 150 tons of it.

![Scaffolding at JSConf EU](contents:images/cms/image-5ce377c8-1000.jpg)

## Why does it cost 55K Euros to rent projectors?

The projectors themselves cost about 110K apiece to buy without the lenses. We
need 7 of them. It adds up.

## How much is catering per attendee?

Very roughly, the food and drinks for 1 day of conference costs €100. This
includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner (no dinner on Sunday) and the drinks that
go with it and which you consume in between. If you’ve ever thrown a wedding or
similar party you know how expensive food is and we operate with a similar cost
model. However, making food for a 1000 people is actually more expensive than
for a 100 due to space and time constraints.

## Why didn’t you release a similar report since 2013?

Because it took us about eleven hours of unpaid volunteer labor to produce this
and it wasn’t high enough on our priority list for a while.

Our way of running events isn’t the only way, and things can be quite different

# Summary

We hope this data is helpful for folks thinking about putting on their own
event. Again, we want to emphasize that our way of running events __is not the
only way__: one of the core goals of the [JSConf](https://jsconf.com/) and
[CSSconf](http://cssconf.org/) families was always to reach as many folks as
possible through a diverse range of events with various pricing models and in
as many regions as possible. If you’d like to run your own event, [please get
