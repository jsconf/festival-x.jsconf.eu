> It isn’t pronounced “Festival __X__”, it’s“Festival 10”.

In all seriousness, JSConf EU 2019 is our 10th anniversary and our event has
evolved from a more classic tech conference, picking up many aspects of art and
music festivals along the way. As we continue to move further in that
direction, we felt it would be fun to reflect this in our name. That is all
there is to it ❤️ And in case you’re worried: It’ll still be one of most the
most technical conferences you’ll ever go to!
