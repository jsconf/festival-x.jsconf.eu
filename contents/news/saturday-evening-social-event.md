One of our favorite parts of running JSConf EU is inviting folks from around
the world and give them a taste of the vibrant Berlin tech community.

At the same time, the Berlin community is way bigger than we could ever invite
to our event, but we want the folks local to Berlin equally have an opportunity
to meet everyone who made the trek to our lovely city.

And as such, in keeping with our 10 year tradition, we are announcing today
that our Saturday evening social event is open to everyone, starting at 21:00.
There is going to be a variety of complementary beverages, some [food for folks
who observe Ramadan](https://2019.jsconf.eu/ramadan/), and [a nice evening
programme](https://2019.jsconf.eu/schedule/timetable.html). And, of course,
Karaoke.

If you are a CSSconf EU and/or JSConf EU ticket holder, you already have free
access to the evening social event, you can even bring a +1.

For everyone else, weâ€˜ve set up a special [Saturday Evening Social
Ticket](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019/with/rt6diurrz60).
