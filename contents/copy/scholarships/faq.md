## Frequently Asked Questions

__I’m not a member of an underrepresented group, can I apply?__

We will likely not consider you in our selection process.

__What does the scholarship entail?__

If you get selected for a scholarship, you will receive a full ticket to JSConf EU and CSSconf EU. Additionally, we will pay for your flights/transport and/or accommodation.

__Can I apply for a scholarship again if I got one last year?__

We will not consider anyone who received a scholarship for JSConf EU/CSSconf EU in 2018, for the sake of fairness.

__How long are applications open for?__

This depends on whether you need a [_visa to enter Germany_](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/visabestimmungen-node). We have two separate application timelines for people who need a visa and people who do not need a visa (i.e. Schengen area residents). The timelines are as follows:

- __If you need a visa__: From 15th of November, 2018 until 30th of January, 2019.
- __If you do not need a Visa__: From 15th of November, 2018 until 10th of March, 2019.

__Why are only applicants without a visa and travel being charged 20 EUR per day?__

This is a good and valid question. In the past we unfortunately experienced a small number of „Just a ticket” scholarship holders that neither informed us beforehand nor showed up at the conference. Therefore we had tickets left which we were not able to give to another scholarship applicant from the waiting list. That’s why we decided to take a small fee per conference day, just to make sure that people who are not able to attend inform us in time. The fee is refunded once you attend the conference or inform us on time if you can not make it at all.

Applicants who need a visa and travel are not among this group since we are in contact with them in the time before the conference, in order to book travel and hotel.
