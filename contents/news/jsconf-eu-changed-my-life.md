**We have a bit of a favor to ask:**

The next JSConf EU will be the [10th and last edition](/an-update/) and we'd
love to use the opportunity to look back at what happened throughout the
years.

We have heard from some of y'all that attending or speaking at JSConf EU has
positively impacted your life in some fashion.

If that is you, please, please, [submit this form with your 20 seconds
video](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5E-qA5DbhuJr7RMZiJV8N1vTQnzkBHdKrw-kBPe25CzKKRQ/viewform).

Thank you so much!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
