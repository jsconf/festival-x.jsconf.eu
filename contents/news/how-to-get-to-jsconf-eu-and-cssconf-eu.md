So, you’ve just arrived in Berlin, and you’re looking forward to attending
JSConf EU and/or CSSconf EU! But you’ve never been in Berlin, and although you
know how to buy a public transport ticket, you’re not really sure how to get to
Arena, either via foot or with trains/buses/trams. No worries! We’ve got
directions for every which way.

## From the bus

The closest public transport station to Arena Berlin, the conference venue, is
a _bus station_ called __Eichenstr./Puschkinallee__. This station is served by
two lines that, for your purposes, run along the exact same route, namely the
_165_ and _265_ lines. This bus station looks like this:

![Photo of bus station
Eichenstr./Puschkinallee](contents:images/cms/image-48ca81fe-1000.jpg)

From here, the Arena is nestled away in a little side road, which you can see
marked on this picture:

![Picture of side road to Arena from bus
station](contents:images/cms/image-97e0d5b7-1000.jpg)

As you get to that road, there’s even signage:

![Picture of signage that points towards the
Arena](contents:images/cms/image-6d391d37-1000.jpg)

Follow that road, and you’ll eventually see the building. It has “arena” posted
to it in big red letters. Below the letters is a sign, take a left here:

From here on out, we have our own signage that’ll lead you directly to the
entrance!

### Alternative Route

If you’re walking from _U Schlesisches Tor_, you may find it easier to take a
left when you see the “Festsaal Kreuzberg” sign. From there, follow the old
tram rails and you’ll arrive right by the entrance!

## By U-Bahn

The closest U-Bahn (Subway) station is __U Schlesisches Tor__. It’s serviced by
the U1 and U3 lines, which both go into central Kreuzberg and Charlottenburg.
From arriving at the station, you can take the aforementioned bus lines. The
bus stop is on the left hand side when you exit the station, as marked here:

![Picture of the bus stop at U Schlesisches
Tor](contents:images/cms/image-a48cde5f.png)

If you want to, you can also walk down to the right, which will eventually get
you to the “Festsaal Kreuzberg” entrance mentioned above (that’s on the left
hand side after you cross a small bridge).

## By S-Bahn

The closest S-Bahn (commuter rail) station is __S Treptower Park__. It’s
serviced by the two Ring (S41, S42) lines which circle around the city centre,
as well as by a line that goes into the centre directly (S9). From here, you’ll
want to take the front exit located at the very end of the platform:

![Picture of the front exit on the platform side at S Treptower
Park](contents:images/cms/image-cc1a2e45-1000.jpg)

Down the stairs, head right after exiting, turn left and you’ll see another
navigational sign:

![Picture of a navigational sign that points towards the Arena at S Treptower
Park](contents:images/cms/image-fe85be00-1000.jpg)

Head in that direction, crossing the street, and you’ll arrive at a bus station
served by the two bus lines that take you directly to the closest bus station.
You can wait for the bus if you’d like, but from here on out, it’s a straight
~5 minute walk until the street where the Arena is at. Just keep going and
you’ll get to the _Eichenstraße_ entrance eventually.

## General tips

If you get lost in the huge maze of bus, train, subway, tram and ferry lines
that constitute Berlin’s public transport, you might want to download a
navigation app like [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com). If nothing else,
[Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/hFnQ2UnxwgM2) does the job, too.

We hope you have a safe trip and we’ll see you next Friday, Saturday and
Sunday!
