In our continued effort to give new voices a stage at JSConf EU, we are
supporting new voices who might want to consider speaking on our stage some
day.

[Jan](https://twitter.com/janl) from the organisation team here is going to be
a mentor at [the Berlin edition of the Global Diversity CFP
Day](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/events/95) on March 2nd.

Global Diversity CFP Day Berlin is one of 80+ events around the globe all
directed towards helping newcomers become professional speakers.

The event is currently fully booked, but be sure to check the signup page
leading up to the event, in case of last-minute cancellations.
