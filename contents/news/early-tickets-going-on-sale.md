Our [first sale of early-tickets](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019)
starts Saturday, Dec 1st, 9am and 6pm CET. This sale includes combo tickets for
[CSSconfeu](https://2019.cssconf.eu/) and JSConf EU as well as individual
tickets for each conference, and of course our famous scholarship support
tickets. Weâ€™re also super happy that prices continue to be stable for 5 years
and counting.
