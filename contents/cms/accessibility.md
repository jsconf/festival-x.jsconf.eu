JSConf EU aims to be an inclusive and accessible conference.

We understand that accessibility is a complex field and we realise that every
person has their own unique needs. As a result, we do have some accessibility
initiatives that help us to set a good baseline. For general services available
at our conference, please see [the about page](/about).

## Early Bird Tickets

If you couldn’t buy an early bird ticket because your accessibility question
couldn’t be resolved in time before they became unavailable, we’re happy to
make sure you can still buy an early bird ticket. Please get [in
touch](mailto:contact@jsconf.eu) if this is relevant to you.




## Personal Assistance / Support Person

Any assistant personnel accompanying you won’t need to purchase an additional
conference ticket. We just need to know they’ll be attending, please [let us
know](mailto:contact@jsconf.eu?subject=Personal%20Assistance).

In case you are invited to CSSconf and/or JSConf EU in any role (speaker,
scholarship holder, MC, artist), you are asked, if you need a support person to
attend the event either for support during travel and/or during the whole
event. If needed and you can’t afford to cover the extra costs for a support
person, we are happy to cover the costs for you and help with travel,
accommodation and a ticket to the conference(s). Please [let us
know](mailto:contact@jsconf.eu?subject=Personal%20Assistance).

_A support person is necessary to protect the health and safety of the person
with impairments/disabilities during the travel and/or events._

The role of a support person is for example: 
* Sign Language interpretation* Prompting or giving advice, including
requesting a break if needed* Providing physical support during travel and/or
the event* Providing emotional support and reassurance during travel and/or
the event

## Venue Description

What you can expect: our main event occurs at [Arena
Berlin](https://www.arena.berlin) in a 6500 square meter free standing hall
plus a number of adjacent rooms and smaller halls. The main hall includes the
main stage, the conference registration, a sprawling festival area with our
conference attractions, community and sponsor booths, and a distributed food
court for breakfast, lunch and dinner. [See our photo gallery from
2018](https://2018.jsconf.eu/news/photos/) for a set of impressions.

## Signage

The event space is equipped with clear signage pointing to everything you might
require to find.

## Noise, Sounds and Lights

During the conference opening and closing and during lunch _at least_ all our
~1200–1400 attendees, speakers and personnel will be in the main hall at the
same time. That is: it will be busy and noisy for at least these times.

During the talks, the audio from the main stage will be audible in the
background throughout the main hall. During the breaks, our Audio/Video artists
will add ambient sound and lighting. In previous years this included loud and
hard techno beats, but we are working with our artists to keep it more relaxed
in 2019 and beyond.

Outside light sources will be dimmed in the main hall during the day, but there
are multiple outside areas for people to recharge on sunlight.

To get an impression for what it could look, feel and sound like to be at the
event, [please see our 2018 mood
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNk28iHdoFk).

## Access for Wheelchair Users and People with Reduced Mobility

We make sure that the main conference is well accessible to wheelchair users
and people with reduced mobility, by both checking with the venue owner and by
visiting them personally beforehand.

The two areas we can’t offer effortless access to is our childcare services and
our prayer room. We have support personnel standing by to help anyone to and
from these facilities.

## Resting Seats

For people who need frequent stops and rests, our main venue is equipped with
various types of seating throughout. So while the event location is extensive,
each individual trip can be short.

## Quiet Area

For people who need a break from the hustle and bustle of the event as
described above, we offer a [dedicated quiet
area](https://www.arena.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/XELJANZ_Launch_Party@Badeschiff_29-Juni-2017_005-1-1.jpg)
that fits about 20 people in total. This is, however, not a quiet chamber
devoid of any sensory input, which is something we would like to offer, but
isn’t possible given the constraints of our venue. Special rules for the quiet
area will be posted in and near the location.

## Live Captioning / Transcriptions

For people with hearing impairments and for people who prefer reading
subtitles, we provide real time presentation captioning for our two main
stages. Additional locations inside the event might also receive real-time
captioning, but we can only guarantee it for our main stages for the time
being. 

Transcriptions will be available on separate monitors close to the stages with
ample space for anyone to see them, as well as a text stream via dedicated URLs
that we’ll publish here closer to the event, which can be used to stream the
transcription to personal devices.

Follow along on your own device, [via these
URLs.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS1X_9muJqy_L3x-k55aXnuOudzugaL4RIgF3TbhFaHiG_MB5oM_6jdgoo3p76WtePz2Ry9N4IjVbRU/pub)


## Sign Language

Due to the variety of sign languages and unpredictability of actual needs, we
do _not_ offer any dedicated sign language interpretation at the moment, but we
are open to discussing options with anyone who makes this a requirement for
attendance. Please get [in touch](mailto:contact@jsconf.eu).

## Childcare

Parents welcome, bring your 3yo+s! When buying a ticket, you can signify that
you are interested in using our childcare services. If there are any things you
want to sort out beforehand, please [get in
touch](mailto:contact@jsconf.eu?subject=Childcare).

Due to building limitations, our childcare facility is on the first floor and
only accessible via a staircase. We have support personnel standing by to help
anyone to and from childcare.
