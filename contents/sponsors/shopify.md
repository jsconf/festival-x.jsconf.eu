Shopify is the leading multi-channel commerce platform. Merchants use Shopify
to design, set up, and manage their stores across multiple sales channels,
including mobile, web, social media, marketplaces, brick-and-mortar locations,
and pop-up shops.

The platform also provides merchants with a powerful back-office and a single
view of their business, from payments to shipping. The Shopify platform was
engineered for reliability and scale, making enterprise-level technology
available to businesses of all sizes.
