## Update May 2nd 2019

Regular tickets are now sold out. The following ticket types remain available
at the time of this writing:

- [Tickets that include a diversity support
option](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019/). These tickets provide a
ticket for you and support our [scholarship program](/scholarships/).

[Buy now! ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019/)

## Update February 10th 2019

After selling out our early tickets and selling our regular tickets for JSConf
in roughly fortnightly batches we are now making a change to how we are selling
tickets:

From now on until the event, tickets will be available continuously until they
sell out. No rushing, or standing in line, but **when they are gone they are
gone.**

One consequence of this change is that we expect to sell fewer of our diversity
support tickets that support our [scholarship program](/scholarships/) because
those used to be the only way to buy tickets between batches. For this reason
we will soon make **all tickets include a contribution to the program.** You
can still buy tickets at the regular price today, so if you‚Äôd rather avoid the
respective ticket price increase, please make sure to make your purchase in the
next days.

We‚Äôll phase in the first scholarship contribution into our regular tickets on
March 1st and then will increase the contribution every 2 weeks:

# Our original ticket sale schedule for informational purposes only

**This info is obsolete. See above for updated schedule.**

We‚Äôre in the thick of preparing everything for JSConf EU 2019 and we‚Äôre happy
to share our Ticket Sale Schedule with you.

All sales start **Thursdays at 9am CET**.

And a quick note that our initial ticket pricing has been stable for the past
five years ‚úåÔ∏è

Mark your calendars for our planned ticket sale schedule üóì<br>
**Pro-tip**: Our scholarship support tickets will stay open at all times üíó

Scholarship Support Tickets available with 25%, 50%, 100% options. üéâ

When you buy a Scholarship Support Ticket, you purchase a ticket for yourself
and enable another person from of our scholarship program to attend by paying a
share towards their ticket.

If you‚Äôd like to instead **apply for a scholarship ticket**, [please head over
here](/scholarships/). üíñ
