Join us for the third annual [TC39](https://tc39.github.io/) panel at JSConf
EU! [TC39](https://tc39.github.io/) is the standards committee that designs the
JavaScript language (sometimes called ECMAScript). The panel will feature a
range of committee members and is your chance to ask questions about the past,
present and future of JavaScript!

### Submitting a Question
To submit a question to the panel, please tweet us mentioning
[@jsconfeu](https://twitter.com/jsconfeu) and

Everybody can submit a question, **no conference ticket necessary!** Like all
our talks, this panel will be published on YouTube.
