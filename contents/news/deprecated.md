After selling out our early tickets and selling our regular tickets for JSConf
in [roughly fortnightly batches](/news/ticket-sale-schedule/) we are now making
a change to how we are selling tickets:

From now on until the event, tickets will be available continuously until they
sell out. No rushing, or standing in line, but **when they are gone they are
gone.**

One consequence of this change is that we expect to sell fewer of our diversity
support tickets that support our [scholarship program](/scholarships/) because
those used to be the only way to buy tickets between batches. For this reason
we will soon make **all tickets include a contribution to the program.** You
can still buy tickets at the regular price today, so if you’d rather avoid the
respective ticket price increase, please make sure to make your purchase in the
next days.

We’ll phase in the first scholarship contribution into our regular tickets on
March 1st and then will increase the contribution every 2 weeks:

| Name            |  End Date            | Gross Price |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Early pricing   | 27th December 2018   | 699€ |
| Regular pricing | 27th February 2019   | 799€ |
| Late pricing 1  | 13th March 2019      | 799€ |
| Late pricing 2  | 27th March 2019      | 809€ |
| Late pricing 3  | 10th April 2019      | 819€ |
| Late pricing 4  | 24th April 2019      | 829€ |
| Late pricing 5  | 8th May 2019         | 839€ |
| Late pricing 6  | 22nd May 2019        | 849€ |

Looking forward to seeing you all in June!
