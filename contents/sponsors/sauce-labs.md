Sauce Labs provides the worldâ€™s largest cloud-based platform for the continuous
testing of web and mobile applications. Optimized for Continuous Integration
(CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD), Sauce eliminates the time and expense of
maintaining an in-house testing infrastructure, freeing development teams of
any size to innovate and release better software, faster. Users can run tests
written in any language or framework using Selenium or Appium, both widely
adopted open source standards for automating browser and mobile application
functionality. Videos, screenshots, and HTML logs help pinpoint issues faster,
and Sauce Connect allows you to securely test apps behind your firewall.
