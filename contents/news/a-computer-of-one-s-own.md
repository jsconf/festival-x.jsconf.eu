We are delighted to announce that we are bringing the exquisite Advent
Calendar: [A Computer of One’s Own](https://medium.com/a-computer-of-ones-own)
to life at CSSconf and JSConf this year as an Exhibition.

Comprising 24 high resolution, exhibition-grade prints in an intimate setting
along with short profiles, we are providing space to explore the lives of the
Pioneers that chartered our Computing Age.

In addition, the project artist [Sebastián
Navas](https://twitter.com/SebastianNavasF) and writers [Florencia
Grattarola](https://twitter.com/flograttarola) & [2018
speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrjbX-KX6wQ) [Álvaro
Videla](https://twitter.com/old_sound) are going to be at our events presenting
the exhibition.
