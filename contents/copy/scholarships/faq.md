## Frequently Asked Questions

__I’m not a member of an underrepresented group, can I apply?__

We will likely not consider you in our selection process.

__What does the scholarship entail?__

We provide two kinds of scholarships, one with travel grant and one without.

If you get selected for a scholarship _with travel support_, you will receive a combo ticket to CSSconf/JSConf EU 2019. Additionally and dependent on what you need, we will organize and cover your flights/transport and/or hotel (up to 4 nights). We will get in touch with you to discuss further travel details but if you have any questions beforehand, please reach out to us via [scholarship@jsconf.eu](mailto:scholarship@jsconf.eu?subject=Scholarship%20FAQ).

In case you get a _ticket-only_ scholarship, you will receive just a combo ticket to CSSconf/JSConf EU 2019.

__How long are applications open for and when will I get feedback?__

This depends on whether you need a [_visa to enter Germany_](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/visabestimmungen-node). We have two separate application timelines for people who need a visa and people who do not need a visa (i.e. Schengen area residents). The timelines are as follows:

- __If you need a visa__: From 15th of November, 2018 until 30th of January, 2019. Our feedback for this application round will be provided by **Friday, 22nd February, 2019**.
- __If you do not need a Visa__: From 15th of November, 2018 until 10th of March, 2019. Our feedback for this application round will be provided by **Friday, April 5, 2019 (postponed from Friday, March 29, 2019)**.

__Can I apply for a scholarship again if I got one last year?__

For the sake of fairness we don't give away a scholarship to the same person within 2 years, this means we won't consider anyone who has already received a scholarship for CSSconf/JSConf EU in 2017 and 2018.

__What is a support person?__

In case you are invited to CSSconf and/or JSConf EU in any role (speaker, scholarship holder, MC, artist), you are asked, if you need a support person to attend the event either for support during travel and/or during the whole event. If needed and you can’t afford to cover the extra costs for a support person, we are happy to cover the costs for you and help with travel, accommodation and a ticket to the conference(s).

*A support person is necessary to protect the health and safety of the person with impairments/disabilities during the travel and/or events.*

The role of a support person is for example:
- Sign Language interpretation
- Prompting or giving advice, including requesting a break if needed
- Providing physical support during travel and/or the event
- Providing emotional support and reassurance during travel and/or the event

__Why are scholarship holders without a travel grant being charged 20 EUR per conference day?__

This is a good and valid question. In the past we unfortunately experienced a small number of scholarship holders that neither informed us beforehand nor showed up at the conference. Therefore we had tickets left which we were not able to give to another scholarship applicant from the waiting list. Applicants who needed a visa and travel were not among this group since we are in contact with them the weeks before the conference to book travel and hotel. That's why we decided to take a small fee per conference day for the scholarships without travel grants, just to make sure that people who are not able to attend inform us on time. 

The fee is refunded once you attend the conference or inform us on time (**until 2019, 29th May**) if you can not make it at all.

__How can I get an invitation letter for my visa?__

Once you get selected for the scholarship, we will send you a form from which we will create an invitation letter for visa. This might take some time, so if your country has specific time restrictions on visas, please let us know in advance via [scholarship@jsconf.eu](mailto:scholarship@jsconf.eu?subject=Scholarship%20FAQ).
