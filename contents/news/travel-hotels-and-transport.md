We collected a bit of information about travel to and from JSConf EU, how to
get around Berlin, and where to stay:

## Berlin’s Airports
Berlin has two airports, both of which are located close to the city center, a
30-minute taxi ride from the venue (ca. EUR 30). There are also trains and
buses that connect the airports to Berlin’s city center.

- [Berlin-Tegel
(TXL)](http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/travellers-txl/to-and-from/buses-and-trains/index.php)
- [Berlin-Schönefeld
(SXF)](http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/travellers-sxf/to-and-from/buses-and-trains/index.php)

## Public Transport
Berlin has many public transport options. The subway, trains, buses, trams are
all operated by [BVG](http://www.bvg.de/en). We recommend getting one of the
[tourist tickets](https://shop.bvg.de/index.php/group/73) for the length of
your stay – this will allow you to use all subway trains, trams and buses in
all of Berlin, plus it comes with discounts for popular sights, museums, and
other attractions.

The bus stop closest to the venue is Eichenstraße/Puschkinallee. Take the 165
or 265 bus there. You can also get there via a short walk from the S-Bahn
station Treptower Park, which is serviced by many different lines. The closest
U-Bahn stop is Schlesisches Tor on the U1 line, from which you can take the
165/265 bus lines mentioned above.

## Bike
Berlin’s flat geography, its many [bike
lanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_Berlin) and the [friendly
weather in early
June](http://www.yr.no/place/Germany/Berlin/Berlin/statistics.html) make it
perfect to get around by bike! Check with your hotel or hostel if they have
bikes to rent out, or find your perfect bike at one of the many [bike rental
places](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=bike+rental&find_loc=Berlin&start=0&cflt=bikerentals).
In addition, there are [a number of bike sharing
companies](https://www.101bikerentals.com/ultimate-guide-bike-sharing-berlin/)
operating in Berlin, which make it easy to rent one-way trip bikes for all
occasions.

## Scooter
For holders of a driver’s license valid in Germany, both
[Coup](https://joincoup.com/) and [Emmy](https://emmy-sharing.de) are ad-hoc
scooter rental companies. A scooter is a nice way to get around the city
quickly.

## Taxi
Taxis in Berlin are affordable and everywhere. You can usually hail one on the
street, or use apps like [MyTaxi](https://de.mytaxi.com/en/index.html) to order
one.

## Accommodation
Below are a two hotels we recommend, both a short walk away from our venue. If
neither of those fit your needs, private accommodation options like
[AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/) are great, too.

- [Holiday Inn (20 min
walk)](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/berlin/berow/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-HI-_-DE-_-BEROW)
- [Michelberger Hotel (20 min walk)](http://michelbergerhotel.com/en/)

If you’d like to team up with other attendees to travel to or stay in Berlin,
