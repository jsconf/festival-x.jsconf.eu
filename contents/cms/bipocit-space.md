The CSSconf and JSConf EU 2019 BIPoCiT Space team believes it is necessary to
create a space that is inviting, supportive, and respectful for all Black,
Indigenous, and/or People of Color in Tech (BIPoCiT).

Our intention is to create a safer space for those who are underrepresented
and/or marginalized – a place for retreat, conversation, networking, and
exchanging knowledge.

The creation of this space is a collective result of previous and ongoing
discussions by BIPoC communities and groups that came before us. We were
inspired by the [POCIT](https://peopleofcolorintech.com/) initiative and the
various meetups and communities built by BIPoC in tech.

The BIPoCiT Space is a place for communication and inspiration, to appreciate
our differences, and to bring strong communities closer together.

Talks happen on the BIPoCiT Space stage during breaks at CSSconf EU 2019. To
learn more about the talks, [visit our speakers
page](/speakers/#bipocit-space-speakers).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does BIPoC mean?

You might be familiar with the term PoC (People of Color), which refers to
non-white people. BIPoC is an extension of that and stands for Black,
Indigenous, and/or People of Color. This particular acronym was created to
acknowledge Black and Indigenous people who have historically been the most
marginalized.

### Is this space for me?

The BIPoCiT Space is for anyone who is Black, Indigenous, and/or a Person of
Color. Providing information about your background is voluntary, and therefore
we rely on your own self-reflection, by asking yourself if you have the
privilege to enter most white-dominated spaces without feeling denied, ignored
or excluded.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form, including, but not limited to,
discrimination against QTIBIPoC/LGBTQIA+ people, discrimination against people
with impairments and/or disabilities, sexism, racism, anti-Semitism,
anti-Muslim or anti-Blackness, or colorism.

### I'm only attending one conference. Can I participate in the space?

The space will be open throughout both CSSconf and JSConf EU 2019, but
attendees will only be able to participate on the days for which they hold
tickets.

### How do I gain access to the space?

You can register on-site at the venue during the designated time blocks. If you
are attending both conferences, you only need to register once. You can also
pre-register on Thursday at the Community Opening event. 

In order to enter the space, attendees will need a wristband, which will be
handed out upon registration. This is for both logistical and safety purposes
and to ensure that everyone who attempts to enter the space knows what it is
and why they’re there.

Registration times:

<b>Thursday, May 30:</b> 5:00pm-9:00pm

<b>Saturday, June 1:</b> 8:00am-11:00am or 1:30pm-3:30pm

<b>Sunday, June 2:</b> 8:00am-11:00am

### What should I do if a conflict arises?

In the event of conflict or an uncomfortable situation within the space, we
encourage you to approach a member of our Awareness Team to mediate the issue.
Members of the Awareness Team are BIPoC who are hired and trained to help
mediate. Awareness Team members can be identified by t-shirts that read
‘Awareness Team’ on the front and back. 

If you don’t feel comfortable approaching a member of the Awareness Team, you
may contact Lauren, Vanessa, and Dera of the BIPoCiT Space team at
[bipocit-space@jsconf.eu](mailto:bipocit-space@jsconf.eu).
