For the second time JSConf EU together with [CSSconf
EU](https://2019.cssconf.eu/) is calling artists to submit their proposals to
participate in our event.

**Update:** Our Call for Artists ended on **January 11th, 2019**

If you make generative art, electronic beats, play violin, sing, or do anything
else really, ~~please submit your proposal through this form by **January 11th,
2019**~~.

We realize there is a huge range to what “art” means. This installation at our
2018 event by [Ian Brill](https://www.ianbrill.org/) and supported by Mozilla
was certainly on the big end of the spectrum:

But no matter what you do, we’d love you to [express your creativity at our
event!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3vGFs8_0_pcMAYEUq8uP3-reyzPMVJwBXSpkjbct9svrBkg/viewform)
Thanks!
