For the fourth time, we are running our Scholarship Program, which provides individuals from __underrepresented groups__ with support to attend JSConf EU and CSSconf EU.

We are very grateful and would like to say a big Thank You to the companies and individuals who donate to our Scholarship Program. In 2018, we were able to give away 80 tickets and we hope to be able to invite even more people in 2019.

Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for a scholarship. We especially invite and welcome Black, Indigenous & People of Color, QTIBlPoC/LGBTQIA+ people, people with disabilities, and people facing economic or social hardships.

If you’ve always wanted to visit JSConf and/or CSSconf EU, but haven’t had the money or resources to, this is your chance! The Scholarship Program was made for you.

❤️ Granting these scholarships is made possible thanks to the wonderful people that buy Diversity Support Tickets, as well as the generous contributions made by our sponsors. More help is needed – talk to us if you’d like to get involved: [scholarship@jsconf.eu](mailto:scholarship@jsconf.eu?subject=Scholarship%20Program).
