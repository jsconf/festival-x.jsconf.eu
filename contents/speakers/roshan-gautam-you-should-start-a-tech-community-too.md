    Hello. Hi, everybody! Wooh! It's finally here. I mean, is anyone playing
    drums around here? Because, you know, I am kind of hearing beatings. I think
    it's my heart beating so loud and fast - I'm so nervous. Thank you, Rachel.
    First of all, I would like to thank JSConf EU for this wonderful community.
    This is my second time in JSConf EU, and second time in Berlin. I had a nice
    time back then, and also hoping to have the same this year too. I was here
    last year on a scholarship - again, thanks to JSConf EU. They're doing an
    amazing job providing scholarships to diverse culture people from people who
    wouldn't be here for the scholarships. So a round of applause, maybe, for
    the JSConf EU team! [Applause]. And, yes, a few disclaimers and excuses.
    This is going to be my first ever talk at an international conference, and
    also my first-ever talk in the English language. [Applause]. I'm used to
    give in the Nepali language, so this will be my first-ever talk. You might
    hear some broken English, and - so bear with me. Another disclaimer: the
    challenges of overcoming techniques that I'm going to mention here in this
    talk are based on my total, I mean, based on my personal experience, and
    it's subjected to change according to the country, according to the
    organiser. Yes, before starting today, I would like to have a few questions
    with the guys. You can raise your hands if you agree with it. And you don't
    have to do anything if you don't. Have you ever started a tech community
    before? Anyone? I can see a few hands. Has anyone here currently leading a
    community? You don't have to - you don't have to be the founder, but you're
    currently leading the community? Anybody? A few. How many of you believe in
    community? By "believe", I mean how many think a community can help you
    grow? It can help you be more productive, and even help. You can be a better
    person? Nice. That's what I feel too. In fact, what I am today, where I am
    today is all because of the community. I'm so into it. So, yes, about me:
    I'm Roshan Gautam. By the way, good afternoon, everybody! I've come all the
    way from Nepal, just finished my bachelor's degree in computer science.
    Actually, waiting for the result of my last semester, so fingers crossed.
    I'm working as a full-time coder in my own company called Technology. You
    can see the spelling right there. I saw my - I spend my time developing
    mobile apps using React Native, mobile apps development for four years now,
    just after joining the campus. When I was in school, maybe grade 8 or 9, my
    dad bought a computer, and I was so into it. At that time, I used to play a
    lot of football - I mean, you understand football, right? So, maybe soccer
    for somebody. So, yes. I used to play a lot of football. After that, I got
    the computer in my home, and in school, they used to teach us QBASIC, and
    one of my elder brothers introduced me with in tool, and I just got into
    programming world from grade 9. I used to get so fascinated by community
    back then as well. I used to create and joined the Facebook groups for
    programming. I created one called Programmers, something like that. On
    Facebook, not that old! Also, I used to join different chat rooms? Yahoo
    Messenger a lot. Yes, talking about the communities. These are a few of the
    communities that I'm currently involved in, and also I was involved in, KT
    MDS. Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and it's a small JavaScript community,
    actually a meet-up group in Kathmandu. I'm currently leading in community so
    I will talk about this in more detail in a moment. Next up, it's Web
    Conference in Kathmandu. I'm so excited to talk about this. I'm one of the
    proud organisers. Have you ever heard of Web Kathmandu, anybody? You will
    have heard about it today! I also talk about this in more detail in a
    moment. It's another is community of volunteers who want to contribute in
    open source, and also in the open way who wants to contribute in open
    source, in a modular project. We organise various events, and activities
    like the selection of the browsers, privacy campaigns, and work - I'm a ...
    another talk at ambassador programme is local campus ambassador in my campus
    while I was there. So, let's talk about KTMJS. As I said earlier, it's a
    community of JS developers in Kathmandu where we gather together, share
    things around JavaScript, just we talk, and it started two years ago as a
    Facebook group. It is still there. I mean, yes. So, we are currently six
    people managing the community, six co-contributors. Until now, we have
    managed to organise around 13 event, and in our Facebook group, there are
    around 1,500 members, so I'm not into all these numbers at all, but I wanted
    to have it in the slide so I could talk about it. So the last meet-up that
    we did was on 25 May. We do a regular meet-up of different formats, like
    sometimes formal, sometimes informal, and sometimes a mix of both. This is
    the photo from the last week of KMTJS. There were 65 people, I guess, with
    four speakers. It was about testing, and security in JavaScript. So let me
    talk about where - let me talk about the conference in Kathmandu, the
    conference that I'm so excited and proud about. It's the only web conference
    in Nepal. There are a few conferences which are related to the workplace or
    something like that, but it's the only conference that - it's a two-day
    conference, but a bit different than the KTMJ - than JSConf EU. On the first
    day, it's talks like this, but on the second day, we do outdoor activities
    like, you know, trekking, and hiking, and roaming around the city together.
    I want to talk about the motivation behind this conference. So, there are a
    lot of experienced developers promising start-ups in Nepal, they are
    scattered and unnoticed. The main motivation behind this conference is
    making these people come together and say about their stuff with - share
    their stuff with each other, and get together and build something, right?
    And also, it's very economically hard for Nepalese, like in their salary
    range to come to this place and attend the conference and not everybody is
    as lucky as me to get their talk accepted and attend the conference or get a
    scholarship. What it aims to do is to provide these opportunities to meet
    people, and attend high-class talks for the local people in Nepal. Let me
    talk about a little bit of behind the scenes, how it all started. So I was
    attending this conference in Iceland. It's JSConf Iceland which you may have
    heard of. I was talking to one of the speakers of JSConf Iceland. He
    actually asked me if there were any conferences that are happening in Nepal?
    At that point of time, I was speechless, actually. So, I was really sad. I
    came back to Nepal. In one of the local meet-ups in my surprise, I found
    this group of people who were actually planning to do a conference in Nepal.
    So, I was so excited, you know? I was attending this conference in all the
    places of the world, but I had not any conferences in my place, so I was so
    excited, I joined the team, successfully organised, the first time in 2018.
    So do you want to know the best part? The speaker who asked me about the
    conference in Nepal will be speak ing at  in 2019 in September 22 to 23rd.
    How cool is that? [Applause]. So these are some of the stats from WWKTM. We
    were initially expecting only 80 people, so I guess around 80 people to
    come, and five or six speakers, but to our surprise, as you can see in the
    stats, there were 300-plus attendees, and ten speakers from 14-plus
    countries. This is the group photo from the Kathmandu 2018. So this was - it
    - so there are a lot of perks going together with community. There are a lot
    of perks when leading a meet-up group or organising events and conferences.
    It's possible to grow together with community, right? You guys believed it
    before. So, if you haven't watched the final episode of Game of Thrones yet,
    this might be the spoiler for you, but I hope it won't matter anyway. Yes.
    How many of you ...! Did you get it! How do you think I came all this way? I
    mean, if it wasn't for community? I wouldn't have been here speaking before
    you guys, organising meet-ups and conferences, giving me the courage to do
    challenging things that even if I'm not very good at it. I hadn't known
    about this conference or I wouldn't have applied for the talk if it wasn't
    for community, and, if I wasn't involved in these kind of activities. So you
    will be more privileged. So list - I was listening to this podcast called
    Howe I Built This? Has anyone heard of that? I was listening to this podcast
    by John from BuzzFeed. He was saying when you get initial success, as he did
    in the Huffington Post, you will get access to greater ideas, resources and
    people, et cetera, that strike me right in. For this, I mean when you lead a
    community or you organise this kind of event, even if you participate
    actively in these programmes, you will have access to more resources, and
    many more available stuff, right? So, you know, you get these perks. I found
    myself doing these things. You can have your own set of stuff. Attend the
    talks actively. Yes, you are the organiser of the meet-up. You might not
    have a lot of time attending the talks, but you have to, you can try to
    manage things in such a way that you are also attending the talks actively
    which will surely help you grow your professional lives and get some skills.
    How many of you agree on this? Reaching out to the speakers, reaching out to
    the speakers will help you grow your communication skills of course. Your
    network of friends and professionals will be wide enough to get more
    opportunities. Challenges that I faced: so, of course, you're going to face
    a lot of challenges if you trying to conduct meet-ups in small communities
    like Nepal, right? There might be a lot of them in different forms. I will
    talk about these challenges that I'm facing in my place, Nepal, and you can
    always deliver them to yours. No wonder you might have differences of
    challenges. Values: yes, in a small community like Nepal, it's really hard
    to get nice conference hall for free of cost. I mean, as we are not well
    funded, and that could accommodate more, more than 50 participants. I
    actually, we, I had to postpone one of the meet-ups because of not getting
    the venue in time, right? That was a very sad moment. Another challenge
    would be to find sponsors. You might not need sponsors to run the meet-up,
    but, in fact, most of the meet-ups that I have organised they are
    sponsor-free. On the other hand, it's hard to organise meet-ups without
    sponsors. I mean, usually, we have - with no sponsors, there are not going
    to be food and drinks for the attendees, right? How actively one can
    participate in the event, a hungry stomach? And also, it's really nice to
    give some token of love to speakers. In my context, the main issue with
    finding sponsors was, like, not so many companies to approach for
    sponsorship. There were not enough companies, there are not enough companies
    in Nepal, sorry, where I can approach for sponsorship. Finding speakers
    turned out to be hard task for me as well. In the case of Nepal, and in the
    case of some of the speakers don't really want to talk in the small meet-up
    like ours, and most of them, most of the engineers, they hesitate to talk in
    public. That's a real problem in our place. So, if you want to share
    something in the community, or if you have done some amazing stuff that will
    help the public, please go forward and don't hesitate about talking in the
    meet-ups. It could be local, or it could be a conference like this. It would
    really help the organisers. The same like the speakers, attendees are also
    like, faced challenges in attendees as well. Senior engineers and developers
    are not willing to attend the meet-up maybe because they feel like they
    aren't going to learn anything from the meet-up, but, yes, most of the
    participants in the meet-ups in Nepal are students. Also, this is the main
    thing, I guess, motivations in teams.. since we are non-funded, we're not
    funded by any big organisations, there might be the loss of motivation in
    the team. Yes, too much or too few meet-ups. This is a very big problem.
    Because of the lack of motivation and the different jobs of the people, of
    the organising team, there might be very few meet-ups, and also there might
    be too many meet-ups. So how to overcome these challenges? Again, these are
    based on my experience, and these things are subjected to change according
    to the country, according to the place, and according to the organiser
    teams. So you can try to find alternative venues. You know, you can talk to
    the schools and colleges, and universities to provide their premises as a
    venue. You can also conduct small meet-ups in coffee shops and cafes where
    participants can buy their own coffee and food, and also you can ask the
    venue providers to provide light snacks and tea and coffee for their
    attendees. In the - senior developers and engineers don't like to go, why
    they wouldn't like to come in the meet-up, it's like they're not going to
    learn anything from the talks, they just want to build their network, but
    students, they like to attend the talks from the seniors, and they like to
    learn programming languages, or something like that. So you can try to have,
    you know, different formats of the events like these talks should not, I
    mean, it doesn't have to be formal meet-ups where two guys come and do the
    frameworks, right, so you can try to do informal meet-ups where developers
    meet and greet, talk about their life, talk about their side projects. You
    can also try doing events in different time, like, sometimes in the morning,
    sometimes in the afternoon, and even in the evening. Right? Yes, the
    meet-ups in the Facebook group can be also very fruitful. Too frequent
    meet-ups in the beginning, we used to do meet-ups efficient week. That was
    crazy. Attendees and even yourself, you don't want to lose all your
    weekends, you know? Going to the meet-ups, and listening to some stuff.
    Having said that, skipping six or seven months for a meet-up is not healthy,
    either. You have to do - regularly, it could be once in a month, or twice in
    - I don't know, once in two months, and something like that. And another
    thing that you can do is let your team member lead the meet-up. I actually,
    did this recently, that I was just talking about the May 25 meet-up. I was
    actually preparing for JSConf EU talk, and I didn't have enough time to
    conduct meet-up, so I asked one of my team members to organise this and do
    anything they like, you know? It was very good thing. I mean, there was a
    lot of - all the people from the team came up, and they started working on
    them, and it was successful. I mean, 65 people were there, and I heard it
    went a lot better. Also, you can get engaged in social media, Facebook
    groups, and invite the attendees to attend, to join the group, and ask
    questions, or something like that. Yes, very, very important, not - yes,
    check feedback from your attendees. It's very important. Like, I told you
    earlier that we are trying to have different formats of events, right? So it
    was because of the feedbacks from the attendees. Takeaways, actively to grow
    and participate with the together, involved in community will help you grow
    your communication skills and professional skills, have motivated members in
    your team. Too many meet-ups and too irregular meet-ups, avoid. Always take
    feedback from the attendees, and screw it, just do it! If you have - if
    you're not getting involved in the local meet-ups, just get involved in it,
    and thank you. This is Roshan Gautam. You can find me in the GitHub. Thank
    you. [Applause]. Actually, one more thing: if you want to speak at
    Kathmandu, we've just opened up our wildcard speaker proposal for a very
    limited tile, make sure you apply as soon as possible. Thanks again!
    [Applause].
