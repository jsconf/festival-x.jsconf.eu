## Voting Process

Voting happens within a jury of four:
- Olivia Hugger
- Princiya Sequeira
- Simone Haas
- Thuy Le

Here’s how we select scholarship recipients:
- Anonymize submissions, so we don’t bias against anything related to the submitter
- There are two rounds of voting for each form:
  - In the first round, we each review every submission and rate them from 0 to 3
  - In the second round, we compare our votes and factor in budget and location
- Finally, we de-anonymize submissions and create a list of people who have been accepted within our budget, and a waiting list in case a scholarship recipient can’t make it or our budget increases
