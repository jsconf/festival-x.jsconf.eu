**[Registration available
here](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/mozilla-webthings-workshop-at-jsconf-eu-2019)**

Attendees will receive a kit that contains the following:

- *WebThings Gateway.* This consists of the Mozilla [WebThings
Gateway](http://iot.mozilla.org/gateway) software running on a Raspberry Pi 3
B+.
- *WebThings Device.* An oddWires [IoT-Bus
IO](https://www.oddwires.com/iot-bus-io-esp32-processor-with-wifi-and-bluetooth/)
development system with an ESP32 microcontroller and touch screen. (For
hands-on WebThings programming using the Moddable SDK or MicroBlocks IDE.)

Attendees need to bring:

- Laptop preloaded with Moddable SDK and/or MicroBlocks IDE. Details below.

## What Attendees Do
- Build your own smart home device that uses the WebThings Framework to
communicate with the WebThings Gateway
- Connect devices to the WebThings gateway to operate the device remotely and
automate its operation
- Learn the fundamentals of the WebThings Framework, including how to define
the properties and events of a device with a JSON object
- Create software to power WebThings devices using the Moddable SDK and ES2019
JavaScript or the MicroBlocks IDE
- Program the touch screen to simulate a variety of smart home devices

## Mozilla WebThings
Mozilla WebThings Gateway and Framework initiative is an open source
implementation to promote a decentralized, W3C-standardized Web of Things
framework to manage IoT device operation and data. Mozilla’s implementation
puts people first, protecting user privacy and security, while promoting
industry interoperability.

## Moddable SDKModdable gives individuals the freedom to take control of the
software on their IoT products. The Moddable SDK brings industry standard
JavaScript to the inexpensive microcontrollers that power IoT products. It
consists of development tools and runtime software for developers to create
truly open IoT products. 

The WebThings module in the Moddable SDK allows you to create your own
WebThings in JavaScript. WebThings created with the Moddable SDK are compatible
with the Mozilla WebThings Gateway.

## MicroBlocks
MicroBlocks is a “live” programming environment. Blocks created using the IDE
on a laptop are executed by a virtual machine running on the connected
microcontroller board. The blocks run independently when not connected to a
computer.

The MicroBlocks IDE includes WebThings library blocks that produce JSON thing
descriptions  and allow you to create your own WebThings that work with the
Mozilla WebThings Gateway. 

## Learning Objectives 
Learn the importance of privacy, security, and interoperability around IoT
devices, and how to implement these principles in your own home. See how easy
it is to set up the WebThings Gateway, and how a free and open source software
system enables you to create your own interoperable WebThings. 

## Knowledge Required 
Simple willingness to learn while having fun. Experience with JavaScript is
helpful.

## What Attendees Bring and Recommended Advance Setup
To participate in hands-on activities, pre-install one or both of the following
tools. If you are comfortable programming in JavaScript, select the Moddable
SDK; if not, select MicroBlocks. 

Option 1: [Moddable SDK](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable)
To use the Moddable SDK, you will need a laptop running macOS, Windows, or
Linux.
Follow the instructions in the Moddable SDK [Getting Started
Guide](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/blob/public/documentation/Moddable%252520SDK%252520-%252520Getting%252520Started.md)
to set up your host environment and ESP32 tools.

Option 2: [MicroBlocks](http://microblocks.fun/)
Install MicroBlocks by [downloading](http://microblocks.fun/download) the
installer for your operating system.
Follow the [setup](http://microblocks.fun/download%2523setup) instructions to
install any necessary drivers to support programming devices over USB.
