    description: >-
      In 2009 I was managing Yahoo’s tech event budget when we agreed to sponsor
      the very first JSConf, the one that almost didn’t happen, the one that
      started something… And though I’ve still never attended a JSConf, nor
      learned to code, the zeitgeist of the JavaScript community and its event
      culture have had a profound effect on how I live and the devrel work I do.


      I’d like to speak about cultivating “JavaScript: The Good Times”—the
      evolution of inclusiveness, the effort to replace customs that no longer
      reflect the values and demographics of the community, the focus on new
      practices for joyful conference-going and knowledge sharing. The
      JavaScript ethos has fueled a reinvention of the tech gathering as an act
      of participation and experiment, generating enduring artifacts for
      learning and excellent new habits for our relationships - personal and
      professional.
