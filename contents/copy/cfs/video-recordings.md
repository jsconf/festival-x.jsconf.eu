## Video Recordings

We plan to record and [publish all talks online for free](https://youtube.com/jsconfeu), along with a recording of the slide deck, live demo, and any on-presenter-screen activity. We do this for the benefit of the larger JS community and those who couldn’t make it to the conference. We hope you agree with us, but if you are uncomfortable with this in any way, let us know and we will work things out. Note that we disabled comments on our published videos by default.

Finally, since you retain full ownership of your slides and recording, we’d like to ask you to make your materials and recording available under a Creative Commons (we default to non-commercial reuse) or other open source license.
