Weâ€™re happy to be able to offer free, all-day childcare at the venue for
children aged 3 and above.

Between 9am and 7pm, there will be a dedicated area with childcare
professionals who will look after your children while you enjoy the
conference.

In order to use our childcare services, we ask that you register a separate,
free ticket below and let us know everything that is important to keep your
child happy during the conference. Please note that places are limited and
available on a first-come-first-serve basis. The service is being provided by
[Kidsevent](http://www.kidsevent.com/). Please check out their website for
additional details (German only).

[Please register your free childcare ticket
here.](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019/with/hebphdfu38e)

In case you're also attending [CSSconf EU](https://2019.cssconf.eu/), please
also [register for a childcare
ticket](https://ti.to/cssconfeu/cssconfeu-2019/with/qdmem2npczs) for that
event.

For parents with younger infants, we will offer a separate room to retreat to,
equipped with comfy seats, diapers and other basic necessities.

We look forward to welcoming you and your children to the conference!
