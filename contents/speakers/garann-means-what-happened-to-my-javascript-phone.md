    >> All right, hi. My name's Garann, and I would like to talk today what
    happened to our JavaScript phones? I want to start off with a hypothesis
    which is that nobody in this room actually has a hacker phone. About five to
    six years ago, I feel like I could have asked you all this kind of
    conference if you had some kind of experimental advice running Firefox OS,
    Ubuntu on your person right now, and there would be a fair amount of hands
    in the air given the demographic of this conference. Today, I doubt there
    are any of those devices here in the room, unless you brought them here
    specifically to troll me? Am I right? I'm assuming that I am! So I think
    it's fair to say that hacker phones as a concept kind of disappeared. We
    just gave up, and we went back to our iPhones and our Androids. It wasn't
    for no reason. We got better cameras, faster modems, and greater stability.
    These phones seemed to get more and more expensive. I can't even fathom how
    I would have justified paying nearly a grand for my first Nokia, but they
    also become more impressive and able to replace our real computers. So you
    could say that they cost more, because they help us accomplish for. They go
    far beyond what we could have done with hacker phones. Except they don't
    work like real computers. We're locked into somebody else's vision of this
    sort of like Ikea office computer that looks pretty convincing, but it's
    actually quite limited. If you don't like the vision that you're offered,
    you have at maximum one alternative option. So maybe that's why I'm up here
    today wondering what happened to JavaScript phones which would blow up this
    field and put the future of these computers back into the hands of your
    average JavaScript developer, the way we grabbed the web back from IE5 and
    Flash. Interestingly, what happened involves a bit of all the things I just
    mentioned. The stunning cameras, the connection speeds, the stability of the
    firmware. And it might seem superficially like this is triumph of the free
    market where the products that won do so because they were simply better
    products. It's actually more of a triumph of old boys' network, monopolies,
    the obtuseness of infrastructure, and fashion having lots and lots of
    capital to throw at something so that nobody else can compete on your level.
    It's not a story of the natural even Lukes of products to become better,
    it's the story of capitalism rewarding capitalism. Let's go back five or six
    years when some of us thought it might play out differently. There are a few
    things relevant to examine from that time that should have culminated in a
    great JavaScript phone - the interest in Cordova and the tools, the
    exponential adoption of Node, and Node bots being like artisan coffee
    brewing, or bread-making or knitting, whatever you're into these days, of
    the day. People searching for ways of web skills on their phones, putting
    Node where they could think of and everybody seemed to have a soldiering
    iron. If that is not a recipe for a JavaScript phone, I don't know what is.
    Some of your babies, you will remember that time, so let's talk about the
    details. First, the state of mobile development was really unresolved.
    People were already developing native apps, and they were making quite
    decent money off them because there wasn't as much competition. So,
    naturally, developers who didn't work in the native languages of the
    platforms wanted a piece of that too or their employers or client did, and
    from there, we got things like phone gap. Phone gap was bought by Adobe and
    became Cordova, a tool to allow JavaScript developers to write a JavaScript
    application and compile it to native code. There was a lot of focus on
    making normal hosted web apps and websites mobile-friendly. There are tool
    kits such as emulators, and intensive theorising about responsive design
    that started appearing out of nowhere to meet the needs of smartphones. You
    could compare it to the current consensus we should be producing
    accessibility websites, but in this case, we actually went and did something
    about it. At this point, testing cross-browser had been a significant and
    limiting piece of work recently. Adding mobile browsers generated mobile
    apps to the list of things to check felt pretty natural, and everybody
    wanted to be on the everybody's phone and we all just did it. That's the
    front-end. On the back-end, you have Node, which at this point is still
    fairly new, or at least is still being treated that way. It's gone through a
    few years of people insisting it's merely a novelty, and people insisting it
    will never have the robustness of Engine X, or Ruby, or the corporate
    assured reliability of .NET. Express has existed a few minutes after Node
    was released so people have been using Node as a web server all this time.
    Even the Node community itself has been trying to distance Node from being a
    web server. I always read it as an unfortunate giving into pressure from
    hacker news-type people to be more serious. There is nothing more serious
    than hardware. At this time, you can assume that you will see people playing
    with circuit boards with lights on them, and somebody's nocopter will be
    sitting on the ground, gathering speculation about what actually needs to be
    fixed, and how sweet it's going to be when it actually runs. The hardware is
    just marketing being useful things to do with JavaScript, not necessarily
    ma'am-up and not individual interfaces. Why not? Scripting languages are
    lovely to work with if introducing the additional layer of abstraction
    doesn't slow things down massively. JavaScript has been getting faster, more
    powerful for years at this point, so that easier adoption makes it a very
    attractive interface to code against. There's one more big things that is
    happening at this point in time, which is that there is a JavaScript phone,
    and at a conference like this, a bunch of people would have had one. We
    talked a little bit about - we will talk about Firefox OS in a second. You
    may or may not have noticed there's an elephant in this room. Maybe it's
    more clear when it seemed like we could have a JavaScript phone, but what
    made us think if we should? If you're thinking that was a really good idea,
    why didn't that happen? Why do you think that? Personally, I wondered if
    today it's too late? I don't know if people still feel this way, or if the
    ship has sailed? Several years ago, though, it was too early to wonder that.
    Another advantage for Apple and Google sharing the smartphone monopoly is
    they have had the privilege of training us all to use their products. If you
    think back, though, people used to have tons of complaints about the phone
    interfaces. But if your echo chamber is like mine, that sort of grumbling
    has died down over the recent years, and if anything, you're left with a
    sniping back and forth about whether Android or iOS is better. Probably not
    even that, though. Because we have no or limited opportunity for
    personalisation, and for deviation from this sort of single-sanction set of
    use cases, there's nothing on our smartphones really to get invested in now.
    That didn't used to be true. There are probably even now things on your
    phone that kind of annoy you, but you found workarounds for them. Like maybe
    the mail client isn't full-featured enough, or the maps give bad directions,
    the system preferences seem intentionally hard to set and confusing. I think
    the big reason that people wanted a JavaScript phone is because several
    years ago, the most serious JavaScript developers still have experience
    writing interfaces. Even if we weren't designers per se, we felt we could do
    better. Because phones at that point were like this trash heap of badly
    functioning operating system and carrier-installed apps and the third-party
    apps that might have improved that situation were treated and super sketchy.
    I believe people wanted JavaScript phones because they wanted to make the
    software on their phones live up to the promise of the hardware. So you've
    been very patient waiting for me to say something about Firefox OS, and now
    I'm going to say something about Firefox OS. Mozilla had a project called
    Boot to Gecko that was meant to give us JavaScript phones. Mozilla was
    probably the only company that could have pulled this off, being a huge
    company that nonetheless maintained an open back-and-forth with the web
    community as a whole and isn't the growth diabetic focused business the same
    as Apple and Google were. The idea was to bring a smartphone to everybody by
    using the power of web technologies. That's clearly not happened. To
    understand why, we need to talk a bit about hardware and what goes on inside
    these little machines. Your phone is a tiny little computer, but it's also
    kind of not. It contains a lot of the same pieces as the computers that you
    work with, the processor, modem, sound, and graphics cards. They're in a
    different format. In the old days, personal computers were hobbyist devices,
    and you could build it yourself to has your own machine. Even big-brand
    desktop machines as recently as the dawn of wildly available cell phones
    were the things that you expected to customise, but that's never been the
    case with phones. Handheld devices have always been largely single units
    that weren't intended to be customised, let alone built from spare parts.
    Today, you can still get a GSM shield, and you can make something similar to
    a phone but a long way from from the definition of mobile phone. Similarly,
    you can sit at your computer and do pretty much everything your phone does,
    just using different networks, but we still don't recognise your computer as
    a phone. The size is a big part of what makes a phone a phone, but the size
    is only important because it offers portability. And portability is only
    useful if you can connect at that cell network. This the - the protocol is
    needed to negotiate a negotiation with a cellphone tower are only licensed
    to carriers. It's not quite as exclusive as it might sound. Even the
    carriers who have their own communications infrastructure will regularly
    rent space on other networks for the client's communications. But it's
    another hurdle for anyone who wants to start making phones. This hardware
    needs to be certified by the individual carriers that it's going to connect
    to, and then it also needs to be approved by the relevant governing bodies
    in whatever countries it will be used in, for example, the FCC in the United
    States. And none of the hardware in the phone exists in isolation, so, if
    you love writing integration tests and stress tests, you will probably spend
    a lifetime being entertained by getting the hardware certified. On the other
    hand, if you have some different agenda by actually releasing something,
    just passing tests and getting certifications could kind of end up being a
    lot. This is where, as JavaScript developers who, as likely as not have a
    front-end and web background when on unfamiliar territory may seem hostile,
    because the regulation the around telecommunications are strict. If
    connection drops because it's something to do with hardware that you're
    trying to distribute, you can't just like throw up an error page with a
    cheeky gif as ask people to reload. Like who would you ask? The modem, the
    operating system? The phone's tight integration means if your hardware fucks
    up, you have to notify every component involved. If your hardware is fucking
    up and makes your component look bad, there goes your certification from
    that manufacturer. Say you're building a cellphone and consider writing an
    application with a bunch of micro frameworks or using an all-in-one
    framework that makes every decision for you. You might be attracted to using
    micro frameworks because you can get the best tool for every job and nothing
    you don't need, but there is overhead associated with making sure that all
    of the micro frameworks co-operate together, eventually, if every micro
    framework you npm install require you to pay fees and be certified, you may
    say fuck it and use a monolith. Your phone is a chip with a big
    high-resolution screen on the other. Everything it does is the same bit of
    hardware. Even the antenna is designed to meander through the phone's guts
    and takes up all the available space left by the geography of the chip.
    There's no market where you can go and buy the most high-end pieces of the
    system on a chip of your phone. The iPhone's chip is designed by
    specifically Apple and produced exclusively for them. You can't get those
    parts. Fairphone couldn't get those parts and Mozilla can't get those parts.
    When a company produces a phone, it produces the whole. Anyone who wants to
    come along and make a JavaScript phone would have to have the same variety
    of skills and large piles of currency and Apple and Google have at their
    disposal to make something comparable to an iPhone or a Android. No everyone
    gives the  a shit about having the fastest camera or modem. Some feature
    phones using KOS which is based on Firefox OS, and some like the Nokia we
    boots using old-school operating systems. If lots of people can come and
    build a feature phone, how come Mozilla couldn't build a $25 smartphone with
    a slightly shittier camera? The answer, which you probably already knew is
    they could have. Mozilla could have bet the whole company on becoming a
    carrier producing hardware giving people lovely $25 JavaScript phones.
    According to people who worked on the project, they nearly did that anyway,
    rather than throw behind becoming a carrier, they looked for carriers who
    would become a partner. Becoming a carrier is time-consuming and expensive,
    so those partners wanted to ensure there would be lots of profits in it for
    them, load the phone down with their apps and get various marketing
    managers. If you're a web standards - if you want to give the world $25
    phones, that's not what you're about. Are there companies that could have
    acted as the carrier needed by Mozilla? Yes. Do such people benefit from
    such a phone give the same carriers many thousands of dollars out of a sense
    of profession that requires them to earn the latest tech? Definitely. Is
    there incentive for those carriers to back a competitor who break up their
    monopolies? No. That's business, and that is what happened to your
    JavaScript phone. Sorry to be depressing. Now what? You're still sitting
    here desperately wishing you had a JavaScript phone, there are a few things
    you could do. Which you would choose depends on what a phone actually is to
    you. For example, most people probably define as a phone as something you
    make and receive calls on, right? Who uses up all their voice minutes every
    month? I don't think a lot in the people do. So you could build your own
    voice and SMS phone with hobby I have the hardware. You could wipe the
    firmware on your smartphone and put a more hackable operating system on it.
    You could work through approved channels and JavaScript apps that improve on
    the things you don't like, our you could rebel. To be honest, I avoid
    working with hardware because it's a little fiddly for me, but I've spoken
    to colleagues and peers about this, and it turns out there are a few little
    chips that you can use to do traditional phone stuff, and an interface you
    can control it JavaScript. I work with Nexmo that provides an API to do this
    kind of communications development, so I feel pretty confident it's
    possible. You could also just put together a piece of hardware that works
    like a My-Fi, and use an API like Nexmo's voice over IP, not worrying about
    carriers, cellphone towers, and all of that, and in theory weep going. You
    could add a nice screen, a graphics chip, an antenna, and you would end up
    with a large thing, not one that matched the power, quality, or size of
    commercial smartphones. You could tick all the boxes. Then you would only
    have to write the firmware for that, so that it functioned together
    seamlessly and automatically, and you didn't have to start an app and click
    a button to connect to the near est cellphone tower. Your grandchildren
    might be able to finish the work you started. So is that the real way
    forward? Maybe. There are projects like the Light Phone that make for an
    interesting argument that the ability to have appealing hardware once you
    scale back functionality is a good trade-off. Maybe a community-driven
    JavaScript phone starts somewhere simple like that, rather than trying to
    compete with smartphones out of the gate, and it builds on the hardware and
    firmware iteratively. Developers as a whole don't have a great patience for
    patience, and team work so don't hold your breath. You might not have a lot
    of friends running custom firmware on their custom hardware these days but
    the projects still exist. If you have different versions of Android, you can
    replace the operating system you like better. This is another option I can't
    speak to you from personal experience, like many people I experimented with
    Linux in college, and it's interesting that the hellscape of finding drivers
    for the perfectly nice hardware I already owned and were in my operating
    system then to use then is the same one I would find myself in if I
    installed a version of Linux on my nice modern Android and gave up on using
    the camera or maps ever again. The risk in flashing your phone is that the
    very nice hardware that lets the manufacturer maybe taken their monopoly is
    operated by a nice proprietary driver, and any operating system under the
    sun could use those drivers and would end up a pretty shit monopoly. Things
    in your phone that have access to the system typically get signed by code
    that lives in a special secure area of the phone, which has its own
    processor and memory sealed off from the rest of the phone. If you wipe your
    phone, you lose access to that area, which you could see at a helpful way of
    stopping ne'er do wells from taking over your - or a cynical way of
    protecting intellectual property. Probably, it's both. Whether good, bad, or
    neutral, though, the security is going to fuck up your phone if you flash
    it, and a lot of people learned that the hard way a few years ago, and
    that's probably why people don't do it as much any more. There are probably
    plenty of people in this room who I've barely addressed you at all, that
    means those who write apps intended to be on smartphones. To be clear,
    there's obviously nothing wrong with that. Does it accomplish the goal of
    providing nicer alternatives to the apps that the phone comes with? It
    absolutely does. You can make - you can't make those apps automatic, and, in
    some cases get people to move your client but move the default to a back
    screen somewhere so they don't click on it. If you can create compelling
    software, it works. If you want JavaScript functionality on your phone, the
    least risky most effective route by far is to write apps. It doesn't look
    like the revolution we were promised, though, does it? I have to ask you to
    indulge my nostalgia as we go back 15 to 20 years. This around the time of
    the web standards movement which you may remember a lot of arguing about CSS
    versus tables, or something to do with XHTML. If you were doing much web
    development around that time, there was a period when developers like us
    argued over and over for taking the more difficult, more expensive, and less
    reliable path of throwing out perfectly good existing product to sign on to
    still very theoretical standards and turn our backs on the powerful,
    established proprietary languages like Action Script that worked great.
    Every day folks using the web weren't clamouring for us to break their
    fucking web pages. That push came from developers like us. I kind of think
    much of the evidence suggests that it will never happen, that a similar
    rebellion is coming for mobile phones. I don't know exactly what that would
    look like, and if it has anything to do with JavaScript, but I it has
    something to do with the fatigue expressed by people intentionally trading
    in their smartphones for feature phones. If the world is deciding this they
    don't literally need a thousand other smart phones in their pocket, just to
    take pictures and send the occasional text, maybe it's really open
    alternative has a chance to compete. If people switch to feature phones and
    don't use as much data and do their texting via T9, maybe they don't want to
    pay for below-the-pack age contracts with the carriers, and so the carriers'
    power comes to a threat, and hardware companies fragment and they seek to
    serve a wider variety of interest. It's a lot of maybes. Even the tools that
    are closed and locked in now began with people working together on
    protocols, electronics, and computer science in public. If you lock people
    into a mono culture where the most exciting innovation you can offer them is
    removing their head phone jacks, they will start moving in other directions
    to find a way out of it. I think a JavaScript phone might still be out
    there. Thanks! [Cheering and applause].
