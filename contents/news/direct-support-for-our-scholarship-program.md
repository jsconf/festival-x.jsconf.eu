The [JSConf EU scholarship program](/scholarships/) has supported folks from
underrepresented groups to be able to attend our event since 2015. For the 2018
event we were able to [significantly scale up the
program](https://2018.jsconf.eu/news/scholarships-awarded/) to and award over
125 tickets in addition to travel grants for people from all over the world.
We‚Äôd love to do even better in 2019 and grant an even bigger group of people
access to the knowledge and networking opportunities of our event‚Äìwhich has
proven to often have a profound impact on their careers.

The program is supported through 3 mechanisms

1. You can [purchase a special
ticket](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019/) that gives a portion of the
price to the scholarship program. This is the right option if you‚Äôd like to
attend the conference yourself and support the program.
2. Our [sponsorship packets](/sponsors/) contain a grant to the scholarship
program.
3. üö® **And NEW: You can now [support the program
directly](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019/with/vblvaztpr9i).**

We added the option to directly support the program through popular demand. In
particular, we‚Äôd love to thank [Mike West](https://twitter.com/mikewest) and
[Whitney Williams](https://twitter.com/whitneyhacks) who independently asked us
to be allowed to make a contribution and together raised 3000 Euros for the
program ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

To make a contribution of any amount, please [go to this
link](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019/with/vblvaztpr9i) and select how
much you‚Äôd like to donate. Please note, that while the conference is a
not-for-profit event, this donation is not tax-deductible. All proceeds will go
towards [our scholarship programme](/scholarships/) covering conference tickets
as well as flights and hotel costs.

It is a privilege for us to be able to run this event, and we‚Äôd love to thank
every single one of you for your generous donations!
