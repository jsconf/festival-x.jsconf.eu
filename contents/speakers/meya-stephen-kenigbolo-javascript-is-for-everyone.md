    That's it! Now I'm a star. I'm done! Thank you. Okay, today I'm going to be
    talking about JavaScript is for everyone. That wasn't supposed to happen!
    And also that wasn't supposed to happen! Okay, hello. I'm Kenigbolo Stephen,
    a lead and advocate. I'm also the community manager for Code Afrique story,
    and I will tell you about the Code Afrique story and why JavaScript is for
    everyone. You can find me on Twitter. Please don't ask me how I came about
    that handle! It's one of those things I don't really want to talk about!
    But, yes. I work in Finland. Who knows about Finland? That's nice. This
    audience is way better. In Finland, we don't smile, so it is do you know
    about Finland? That's pretty much it! I'm going to be talking about
    JavaScript being for everyone. This is basically how it's going to go. I
    will talk about what Code Afrique is, why we do what we do, an important
    disclaimer: you may not like a lot of the things I'm going to say today but
    I think it's important to state these things. There's been a huge
    dysfunction between teaching JavaScript and getting beginners into the
    industry. I'm going to talk about the team behind Code Afrique. I'm going to
    be telling you how we teach JavaScript. I'm going to tell you about Amber,
    how the conventions of configuration have changed. Beginner concepts that we
    used Ember to do, and a history of where we came from and how we decided to
    go with this. What is Code Afrique? Nothing fancy, just giving back to the
    community. It's a bunch of students, doing a masters in software
    engineering. We figured out the problem in Estonia and decided to get
    together to solve it. I'm going to tell you what we did. What do we do, and
    why do we do what we do? Who understands what this means? Okay. Very few
    hands. But this basically explains why I'm giving this talk. In case you
    missed it in my previous slide, I used the word "under represented"
    highlighted in red for a reason. I would like to redefine this word. I see
    myself as a marginalised person. In 2015, I was doing a Masters in software
    engineering?  In Estonia. We have a lot of people of colour in the country,
    not so many but a significant number. The issue was it was difficult to get
    jobs, right? There were a lot of people who wanted to get into the tech
    space and it was difficult to get in and the reason was we had created this
    barrier for them, assuming that everyone had the same cognitive abilities.
    This is a bias, a lot of us have. We don't necessarily do it intentionally,
    but this is it. A random question: how many people who make tutorials or
    teach people think about learning disabilities like ADHD, for example? Very
    few hands. How many people think about people who are not really able to
    learn not because they're not smart enough, but because they didn't have the
    same privileges that you had? Do you ever think of that? How many people
    here got their first computers before 15? Okay. You see these hands? I never
    got a computer before 15. So, what whether I like it or not, I didn't get
    the advantages that others had. This is why we came about Code Afrique to
    actually try to boost that gap and give people the ability to actually get
    into the industry without thinking so much. Yesterday, something happened,
    and I basically wanted to call out this. I thought it was important. I would
    like to change the narrative of we being under represented. I quote Brian
    Lyells when he says you're not under represented before, you're over
    represented. I'm sorry, but this is fact. We are black, indigenous people of
    colour in IT, and we are supposed to be here. We're not here as a quota, we
    are here because we're supposed to be here. We don't want to use negatives
    to address ourselves in the industry, we want to be seen as people managing
    our lives, not under represented. Hopefully, I hope that by the end of this
    talk everything thinks this back and puts it on the back of their minds.
    Would you believe me when I tell you there are a lot of amazing ideas that
    because it belongs to a person of colour or a marginalised community? How
    many people actually believe this? It is always difficult when you need to
    go and talk for funds when you belong to a specific demographic. It's not as
    easy as a lot of people think. This it is one of the reasons where we
    decided we want to bring this community to get people together, people who
    belong to these under represented groups and then teach them JavaScript in
    such a way where they don't need to be so much worried about the toxicity we
    have not industry. They could just come and learn, and afterwards explore.
    So, yes, like everyone else, I think we all deserve an equal chance. It
    might not be nice, it might not be comfortable for some people, but we all
    deserve an equal chance. I'm not sure about pizza and - I'm a pizza person,
    so maybe the Americans may not be so happy but I like pizza more than ...
    we're a bunch of regular people. The folks who work at Code Afrique, that's
    Gabriel. This is Sunday. And this is Victor, all senior software engineers.
    Two work in Canada and one works in Estonia. We started Code Afrique
    together in 2016, and we've been going strong there ever since. I'm going to
    give an honourable mention to a friend called Fortuna based in Estonia. He
    helped us discover a better way to actually accommodate people when we need
    to teach JavaScript. Now, one of the biggest things we found out about
    JavaScript and getting people into the industry is the conceptions of pure
    evil. One of the preconceptions is that JavaScript is easy. You can say that
    when you're not a beginner. If you've never written a line of code,
    programming is never as easy as you think, and this is something I want us
    to remember when you have to teach people. The fact that you understand it
    does not necessarily mean they will understand it the way that you do. The
    fact that you have the ability to assimilate things does not necessarily
    mean they would have the ability to assimilate it in the way that you will.
    The JavaScript community out here, there is no control of people grasping
    the concepts. This is not the fault of JavaScript but down to the fact that
    people learn differently. Where we've made the mistake is not taking time to
    find ways to accommodate the different type of people who need to learn. We
    have been very mainstream in the way we teach JavaScript, and I'm hoping
    that, as we go back today to mentor people, those who have junior
    developers, we take this into consideration about who we are teaching what
    the situations might be. Sometimes, it's not only about learning
    disabilities, it could be emotional, mental, physical. Let's always put that
    into consideration when we need to teach. Now, JavaScript does not have to
    be complicated as much as we tend to make it complicated. I strongly believe
    it doesn't have to be. JavaScript is a beautiful language. I didn't come
    from a JavaScript background. I came from a C++ background but of since I
    got here I don't want to go back because I love being here. However, we have
    created a barrier that makes it difficult for people to come into the
    industry, and just before I go, a quick question: how many people here work
    in front-end development? Awesome. That's a lot of hands. Okay. This should
    have been named JSConf front-end! How many people as front-end engineers
    have had to traverse a binary tree in their regular day jobs? That's very
    few hands. I can't even count. How many have had to use the big notification
    in the regular jobs and front-end engineers? Also very few hand. Now, think
    about it: why do we need to actually make beginners scared of getting into
    the industry by bombarding them with all this information instead of getting
    them in and easing them into learning? Why can't we do that? Why do we
    always have to make it so complicated? So we designed a simple way to
    actually teach beginners, and it's basically this: because whether you like
    it or not, these are the three building blocks of JavaScript. The moment you
    can understand these three concepts, it makes it easier for you to go on and
    explore different other things. We basically decided to use the pattern
    explaining variables and objects and methods going through this way. We
    think it's easier. It has worked for us and enabled us to get out the 15
    students we initially take, get nine of them into the industry, they're good
    engineers, they're still young, they still have a lot of time to improve,
    but they're learning, and it has shown us that there is a possibility to
    actually ease people into the industry without necessarily complicating the
    entrants. We need to think about the different type of people. We need no to
    think about the different communities and find a way to get everyone in
    without necessarily unintentionally excluding them. Now, the biggest problem
    we face when we need to teach people, and this is not - this is by no means
    me lashing out at anyone, or any particular thing, I'm just saying the
    JavaScript community has grown so big, and something that is supposed to be
    a huge help for us has unfortunately turned out to be a problem, and that is
    that? This is it. Yes. And, again, pretty much frameworks. Frameworks was
    supposed to make software development easy. Frameworks were basically - we
    started building frameworks to enable people become productive easier.
    Unfortunately, we have started making frameworks that by making it more
    complicated for people to get in, and this is now not a lash-out to anyone
    or framework. In my team, we use four different JavaScript frameworks for
    different projects. Every one has its pros and cons. I think that it's
    important that when we build this, and even when we make tutorials, we take
    into consideration the different type of people that need to learn. Now, I
    like Ember, and I'm going to make a disclaimer: I am not sure  I'm not
    connected to Ember. I'm only speaking it in the context of how we use them
    by giving people simple instructions. There's something very controversial
    about Ember. I wouldn't say controversial but a diverse opinion. It's a
    convention over configuration. A lot of people feel that this is not so
    good. And that's not justified. They have their reasons. A lot of people do
    believe that conventional over configuration is quite important, and they
    have their reasons. Now, starting in Code Afrique, we actually went ahead to
    teach people in terms of the different things that we needed to show them.
    What we discovered was that it was easier to actually use Ember because we
    could give them a set of instructions to follow. One of the most important
    things you enjoyed as a beginner was writing the line of code and seeing it
    work. We gave them an opportunity to see their work progress, enjoy that
    excitement, and then go on to dig deeper behind the basics, why this works
    the way it works, with , instead of working in the reverse pattern. So
    typical pit stalls we encountered with trying to use frameworks.
    Lazy-loading. Too many computer science concepts that is front-end
    development. It doesn't have to be so complicated. Come on. Some frameworks
    seemed to be front-end frameworks designed for back-end developers. A lot of
    people here can agree with that, I'm pretty sure we've all seen it. You
    probably know what I'm talking about. Yes, and then some things aren't
    designed for beginners, it's true. As much as we would like to say it is,
    it's just not designed for beginners. It's not beginner-friendly. There are
    tons of other things but I will skip that and talk about the basic ones. At
    this point, I'm going to play a nice video. Hopefully, the musical part is
    actually removed. This was a video made by one of our students and I
    promised him I was going to play here. 

    >> Thank you. God bless America. [Applause]. 

    >> It's a representation of how the different technologies and frameworks.
    [Video]: "Nice to meet you. What's up, Graham. You know this. Heath
    Williamson. Nice to meet you, sir. Come on. Come on. Emily George. How are
    you doing? All right. Never forget about that. That's all we got. Nice to
    meet you. All right. Oh, bring it in! Starting from the bottom now we are
    here. Nice to meet you. All right. All right. Nice to meet you. One - bring
    it in there. [Voices overspeaking]. Nice to meet you. My goodness. Look at
    this. Oh.  She is so beautiful. Mmm. I want another one. There you go.
    Precious. Beautiful. Beautiful. What's her name? This is Libia Roogie. Come
    on, there he is! All right, very good to meet you. Here we go. [Laughter].
    " 

    >> Okay, so I'm just going to round up. That was pretty much it. I would say
    a big thank you to all the people who work with Ember guides, teaching Ember
    and JS has been amazing because of the way the documentation is designed. A
    huge shout-out to your communities. The documentations are totally amazing
    and they make teaching easy for us. Routers, and this is no beef against any
    framework, but not having to teach people about routing, not having to tell
    people listen, I need you to go and install this particular framework router
    to get started helps us a lot because it eliminates the need for people to
    worry about that. When they want to learn about routers is doing it in their
    own time. They want to get productive and learn code. Handle - data binding.
    We can't actually teach data-binding without teaching data-binding.
    Basically, they can get productive and understand it and when they want to
    dig deeper, they have a better overview of what data binding should be and
    how it should work. Lastly, convention. We all have different ideas about
    convention, but as someone who has taught Ruby on Rails, and em-R Ember, I
    think for beginners, it's important to give learners a set of guidelines to
    use and work in. Just I'm going to show a couple of little things. So this
    is pretty much lazy-loading in Ember.js. This is how straightforward it was.
    I only need to explain what Lazy Loading is and show them is. No disrespect
    to Angular, if I want to do this in Angular, it's not so straightforward.
    This is one of the issues we face. You need to make sure you can go into a
    lot of core concepts. Going into a lot of core concepts for people you're
    trying to get into the industry might just be a way to chase them away. So
    using simpler methods, using this kind of method, and using convention over
    configuration, we can do this and show it to to them  better. I hope a lot
    of frameworks will make it easier for people getting into the industry. This
    is a simple routing function in Ember.js. This is a simple explanation. This
    is all I need to tell the student that how the routing itself would work,
    and this would make logical sense because it follows systematically the way
    it will flow. Lastly, this is a code written by someone who learned
    JavaScript for four days. He literally just learned objects, variables, and
    functions, and then he came up with this. I promised him I was going to put
    this up there because four days in, I couldn't write this. Somehow, we are
    actually doing something right, and I'm hoping as we go back, we learn to
    actually help people learn properly. Moving forward, we've run the code to
    reload. We still have Code Afrique as an online version and Reload is a boot
    camp for people who identify as marginalised groups. You can find us on
    Twitter. If you would like to be a mentor to some of our students, we would
    love that. And many thanks to the following organisations. The Association
    of African Students in Estonia. They gave us to the - and the Talin
    Institute of Technology. Our classrooms are located in the institute, and a
    huge thanks to my company. I'm paid to be a developer-advocate that doesn't
    need to come and talk about ... but I - our huge thanks to them. Lastly, I
    wanted to mention about mentoring, because this is also a fundamental part
    of JavaScript that we have actually forgotten. Now, a huge shout out to the
    node.js community. They have an awesome mentoring system. It does have a
    little flaw and hopefully sometime I'm going to bring that up when I can,
    but I just wanted to point out that if you know you mentor anyone, if you
    know you're a senior engineer and you have junior engineers in your team,
    mentoring is not good enough. You need to open them to your network. You
    need to give them opportunities. It's wanting to say yes, I'm a teacher, I
    have four mentees. How many are working? It's important that we keep this at
    the back of our mind when we teach. It's another thing to pass knowledge and
    another thing to give people confidence. While you mentor people, giving
    them opportunities. I used to be at fault for this because I have seven
    meant yes, sir - what was I missing? On linked linked, if I see a job, I -
    if - I can say all seven are working today. One will be a senior engineer,
    he's just within three years be he is smart because he has a CSS background.
    It's important that we open up people to our networks. I'm highlighting the
    mentees that we have at Code Afrique because they came from a very different
    background. He's a journalist, and when I look down there, he actually also
    doesn't have a CS degree. She started studying marketing, but they're all
    engineers now, and we're really proud of what they do. I hope we can
    encourage people to get into tech this way. Lastly, I'm going to point this:
    who has had this raised before? - who has heard this phrase before? What
    this means is that it is all about sharing what has been bothering you for a
    long time. Mostly things that, you know, you usually don't have anyone to
    talk about, but you would like to talk about it. The reason why I do this is
    because every time I come to a conference, I have students who are back home
    listening, and I want the experienced developers here to please go on
    Twitter and talk about your most vulnerable times, talk about those things
    that you can't remember. You can go on Twitter, for example, every single
    time I need to Google how to use the reduce function because despite the
    fact I've been programming for over five years, I don't seem to grab it. I
    have to check out the reduce function. When you say this to young people, it
    doesn't matter the age, but people who are young in the industry. You give
    them some sort of confidence and let them know we're not all Superman.
    Everyone makes mistakes and has a part they're not comfortable with. I want
    you please to share your stories. I'm going to go on Twitter quickly and
    post this. So please indulge me. I prepared this tweet just ahead of time.
    You can go on the  there and write the themes that you consider to be the
    most vulnerable things as a senior developer, what things do you forget
    regularly? As a senior developer, no matter how much I think I know, I
    really don't know shit, unfortunately, because, when I went to EmberConf I
    sat with Yehuda who was a role model for me, when he started to contribute -
    I realised, like, oh, boy, I have a long way to go, you know? So please
    share your stories with them, and encourage them and make them understand
    that it's okay to make mistakes. We all make mistakes regardless of how many
    years experience we have not industry, everyone makes mistakes and you can
    learn from them and be better. I started going back. And with that, I say
    thank you. You can find me on GitHub, and Twitter, and you can send me an
    email. The word you see there is the one thing I want you to learn about
    Finland today - how we say thank you. Thank you very much! [Cheering and
    applause].

Teaching absolute beginners with no technical experience whatsoever to
understand Javascript can be quite a daunting task. It's more challenging if
you have a thick British accent and your students are mostly African students.
If you've ever designed a tech curriculum then you understand how complicated
this can be. At code Afrique where we help the community by offering a free
weekend intensive bootcamp, we explored and have now achieved success with
ember where we had earlier failed. The aim of this talk is to show, what we
tried, where we failed and how Javascript via Ember brought us success like no
other.
