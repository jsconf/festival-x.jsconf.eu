    >> Thank you very much. Hi, everybody. How are you all doing today? Jump up
    and down a few things. Stretch a little bit. High-five the person to your
    right because you can. My name is Adam Miller. This is OpenJS. This is
    between you and me, we won't tell the panellists, how many people know what
    the JS Foundations do, and interact with them a lot and should be up here on
    this panel? I see a few hands. Who knows that the foundations exist and kind
    of know what they do but really ... couldn't give a talk on it or be on the
    panel here. Here is, "We're talking about foundations? We're talking about
    open source, right, why is there a foundation involved?" We've done a lot of
    work recent to merge together the Node Foundation, and the JavaScript
    Foundation into the OpenJS Foundation. It's been a ten-month process or
    more. We are really excited to share with you what we've been doing. There's
    an awesome panel of people here who are have been rocking it on the
    foundation formation side, and I guess we will about down the line and do
    intros here. 

    >> You have a standalone full-screen experience from looks like any other
    app on the iPhone. So it's basically a PWA. Then you have - feature phones,
    I have this Nokia here with me, feature phones, non-touch, they're
    supporting PWAs. But it's not just on mobile. On desktop you can go and
    install Trivago, Tinder, by the way, and you have a - that works on Windows,
    Chromebook, Mac and Linux. You can open more PWAs at the same time. We have
    the properly, we just need to create really, really good experiences, and
    today, let's say that I can say that maybe half of the PWA s out there on  R
    offering a good experience. The other half are away for offering a
    competition like the native apps, and so we will try to see why, and what we
    can do today to improve that experience. So, talking about the app cycle,
    okay? So because we are creating apps, not just websites that will appear in
    the browser. So, when you open a PWA, so if the d Platform. I'm Google's
    representative as a platinum member board representative and the vice-chair
    of the Open JS Foundation. Before that, I was the elected representative on
    the board prior to the merger in the original structure of the node.js
    Foundation. There were three board seats that are community members. Tracy
    had one of them, and I was representing the other group. 

    >> I'm Adam Miller. In the daytime, I work on LinkedIn. We can't talk to the
    future of the organisation without looking to the past. I would like to get
    a tl;dr on the node  Node Foundation and the JavaScript Foundation. 

    >> So a the although of people may not realise that the JavaScript community
    has had a foundation working on behalf of open-source projects for a long
    time. Back in the mid-2000s, we had the jQuery project that got wildly
    popular and we made a foundation for jQuery that added projects over time
    which later merged with what was the Dojo Foundation which had a handful of
    projects itself and just kind of that was about three or four years ago, and
    so that was when we became the JS Foundation, and we've been rocking along
    behind the scenes for quite some time. 

    >> And the Node JS Foundation was formed in 2015 to provide a future place
    where a number of different groups within the node community could come
    together and work on figuring out how to move things forward into the
    future. There was a few sort of key things that were important, which I
    think we will see flow through so what we see in the OpenJS Foundation as
    well as that neutrality, if they contribute, they have the tools and the
    access that they need to make things happen. That is something we will see
    reflected in what we talk about in the OpenJS Foundation as well. In
    September 15, we - we've seen consistent and reliable releases ever since
    then. I think it's a good sign of the stability and the ability for
    everybody to get in in work together on that front. 

    >> Yes, I know early on when it was just in early discussions about the two
    foundations merging, there was a good bit of uncertainty about whether it
    should happen, whether it was the right time to do it. I know a lot of you
    feel that a lot of those concerns early on, I was hoping you could answer
    maybe why not, and why merge? 

    >> Can you repeat that one more time really quickly? 

    >> Why are we merging now and why - what is the reason for the merge? 

    >> It's been a long couple of days! So there are a number of different
    reasons to consider merging foundations. If you go and look at the bylaws of
    the foundation itself, right in there, we claim that we want to be a centre
    of gravity for the JavaScript ecosystem. Prior to there being one primary
    foundation, it wasn't really clear. And it's hard because Node was the main
    project in the node.js Foundation, and joining something bigger means giving
    some stuff up, and there's an anecdote I really like. When I kind of started
    getting into the node.js ecosystem, when I had just moved to California, I
    got - I got a free ticket to go to a conference called Node Summit. This was
    right around the time of the fork, and they were talking about merging, and
    I have no shame, so I walked right up to Scott Hammond at the time the CEO
    of Joyant and asked him why would you put Node? A foundation - in a
    foundation? He said it's better to have a smaller piece of a bigger pie. To
    me, when I think about these foundations, and we just had our summit
    recently which was fantastic, and so many new faces in the room that weren't
    there before, we just massively expanded the scope of the work that we can
    do, who we can work with, how we can work with them. We get to revisit all
    of these kind of preconceived notions when Node first went in the
    foundation, it was very reactive. We had things that we needed to protect
    and fix and now we can be proactive and start thinking about what we want to
    build. 

    >> It made me think we all know we can accomplish a lot more than we could
    on our own as an individual, so it's the same thing for a larger
    foundation. 

    >> And sort of wearing the Node hat, there was a lot of scepticism when we
    were talking about a merger. And not - I wouldn't necessarily say it was
    balanced. There was a lot from the Node side, and, again, it was because we
    had experience going through I think a pretty tumultuous foundation
    formation not too many years ago, and Node was finally feeling like a stable
    place sort of firing on all cylinders, we were working together in the
    community, and the TSC, but I think as part of that, we ended up seeing how
    bringing in the up stream components in the JS ecosystem, that, like, we
    were stronger when we were doing that together, and so by focusing on these
    sorts of things that we had already learned, transparency, including not -
    not just including - giving autonomy to the project members so they could
    run and host these meetings, we ran weekly meetings when it came to the
    merger discussion and planning so whatever wanted to drive the planning from
    particular initiative phases of making this merger happen, it was only going
    to happen if people showed up and did the work, and that is from the project
    side, not from the board side. 

    >> Yes, I will add that on the .just Foundation side, we immediately you a
    the benefit of possibly merging with the Node ecosystem because all of our
    projects really rely on Node. At the same time, there was fear and
    uncertainty because there was a lot of historical drama, and energy from the
    community which may be disruptive to what was otherwise fairly stability
    projects. So, you know, with that optimism, but cautious optimism in mind,
    everybody got really excited about the possibility of collaborating more
    closely with their peers on the Node side through one umbrella, and I think
    that's kind of what put us over the edge. 

    >> And one of the things that building on what both Tracy and Jory was
    saying, from the get-go, we approached this from an egalitarian mind set. We
    made the doors open, like we tried to be hyper inclusive as much as
    possible. If you are a member or a committer, and even then we weren't that
    picky, like, if you wanted to show up to those meetings and you wasn't being
    disruptive, you had a voice and a seat at the table, and were participating.
    I think that was really important to make sure that this could be
    successful. 

    >> I was going to say, we looked at the governance for a number of the
    different projects, for the Node Foundation, Kubernetes, and I'm happy that
    we ended up with something that is the most, has the most opportunity, and
    hopefully the best place where people will want to come and will attract a
    lot of good people through that. I'm happy by looking at that, we ended up
    with that open and really nice governance. 

    >> I think in all of this drives home the value of this work is always
    project-driven, and that's the point of the foundation, is to help empower
    and give autonomy to the projects, and get sort of the crap out of the way
    for them to be able to do their good work. 

    >> I think what I've heard on that front is we talk about great projects and
    the focus will be on those great projects, not the foundation itself. 

    >> So let's dig into some of that nitty-gritty. Almost everybody in the room
    here is an engineer, and I have always held the opinion that governance is
    just coding but with words! It's really what it has felt like over the past
    ten months, and we have a visual aid here as we talk about it. Let's dive
    into some of the more nitty-gritty details here of under the hood of what is
    kind of making this foundation, new foundation tick, and we can talk about
    some of the back story, and reasoning behind these sections of the
    foundation. Yes, so, I mean, let's take it from the top and go OpenJS board
    and talk about their functionality. 

    >> To start out with, I talked about the governance. We have multiple levels
    so there are observers. Any who wants to can come up and participate in the
    meetings. We want to get as many different ideas to come to the best
    answers. We have regular members who can actually, people who in my mind who
    said I'm making a commitment to be involved regularly and they can  they can
    be recognised for that. Again, both observers and regular members are
    involved in all of the work that goes on. And then finally, we have voting
    members where in the rare cases where we need to actually have a vote on
    something, it's that subset who will do that vote. Now, our experience in
    the Node project at least has been that votes are very rare, we follow a
    consensus-seeking approach, and really it's going to be all of those members
    who have ownership and who push things forward, and so it should not really
    matter which level you're in, but we have just to have the different levels
    for the contingencies. 

    >> One thing that I can add, a mantra I would tell myself, was that we
    wanted to create structures and hierarchies of responsibility rather than
    power. So there isn't fundamentally a major power balance between any of the
    members of the any of the projects, being a voting member just means you're
    more responsible. You need to be showing up. You need to make sure that
    things are getting finished but you just don't get to shut down another
    person's voice because you have that responsibility. 

    >> The governance is really written so that all the responsibilities of the
    CPC are the responsibilities of all the members as opposed to anybody in
    particular. 

    >> I want to talk a little bit about the projects if we can, the staging,
    because I think for me, this was a big bringing all JS Foundation projects
    on board, and important they had a voice in the project, and where they were
    going to derive value and get value and services from the organisation, so
    we came up with this proposal that was loosely based on the CNCF model of
    impact projects, growth-stage projects, and what is not pictured here is
    there a project which we have six projects that we deemed, and the projects
    themselves opted into this stage, functionally complete. We recognised and
    thanked them for their contribution they made to the comment but we're not
    really encouraging people to go and contribute to those projects or adopt
    those projects now. We have five impact projects which are sort of the
    projects that are a real kind of need to have some resources and support on
    a very active basis from the foundation. They're used heavily in enterprise,
    and they need that backing. We have six growth projects and that stage is
    for projects that have a specific objective in mind, like there is a goal. I
    need, I want to grow my contributor base. I want to increase the number of
    implementations. I want to put on an Yvette, or something like that. They
    have some specific goal for which they need extra resources from the
    foundation for a short period of time, growth stages for those projects, and
    then we have 15 projects that are projects that are fine, they're kind of
    doing their thing, their resource needs are pretty set, and we don't have to
    do too much to support that. 

    >> One thing I can add from the At Large is the Node Foundation, that was
    the only project. That was half true. It had attempted an incubation
    programme to bring for projects in. I personally, and I can't speak for how
    other people feel, I don't feel that programme was successful. While we were
    merging, we have to make sure that all projects are accounted for, and both
    ... and Express primarily wanted to continue operating the way that they
    were, to be able to not to have anything day-to-day change, and perhaps have
    a bit of a better idea of what resources were available to them such as CI,
    or legal counsel, or PR and marketing in case they needed it, but they
    mostly didn't want anything to change. By coming in as an At Large projects,
    these two projects mostly on rails doing their own thing, as far as I know,
    and I'm saying this because we haven't heard anything from them, it seems
    like everything's going fine, and there's been pretty much no change
    day-to-day, and so to me, I see a lot of these projects as you do your thing
    the way you want to do your thing, and we are here to support you when you
    need it, and one of the really big things I think we will want to be doing
    in the near future is codefying and making it far clearer what resources are
    available, how to get access to those resources, and how to create
    programmes for new resources if they're not available yet. 

    >> I think we're better set up now to deal with and cope with the different
    requirements or aspirations that each project will have as opposed to being
    part of the node.js Foundation where you're a small part of a bigger
    project. 

    >> Do you want to talk about the membership structure and how representation
    works at the layer above the CPC? 

    >> Sorry, can you repeat that? 

    >> Do - I would love to hear more about the membership structure and how the
    CPC interacts with the rest of the org a little bit. 

    >> I think, Adam, let me know, you're asking about how is the CPC formed and
    what is the structure of the foundation on the community side? 

    >> Yes. 

    >> I will start. One thing that is really important, and this is the only
    thing I really wanted to say, is that the board which we are seeing over on
    the left-hand side, which is made up of a number of different members from
    corporate entities, as well as  as well as three three community members
    right now, it is three, it will go down to two soon, there is governance -
    grab me, I will explain - but that group is responsible for the things that
    you see listed there. They do not have authority over anything else. The
    rest of the day-to-day operations of the foundation that you see under the
    Cross Project Council As well as the technical governance of project is
    completely air gapped. The boards and projects can work together on things.
    It doesn't mean that we are not partners. But what it does mean is that the
    foundation cannot install people into a project. 

    >> I think a good example here I can provide is what happens if a code of
    conduct violation happens with someone on leadership in one of the projects?
    What one would hope is that a project would be able to manage that conflict
    themselves and resolve it. It's really hard to have to enforce those
    policies on someone that you've worked with for years, that you've seen work
    really hard, but that you're seeing disagreements on. So, you know, by
    experience, we've seen this sort of happen that you could end up having it
    saying like, board, we need you to provide an answer because we don't really
    know what to do here, and we know you have experience at it. The board,
    instead of saying, okay, you're going to do this thing, it's instead saying
    we are going to help you provide resources, and we're going to work with you
    together to figure this out, but ultimately, you're responsible for this
    work. We just want to be here to guide you and provide the monetary
    resources, the legal resources, to help resolve that together, and hopefully
    we will be better for that in the long run. 

    >> Taking on from the board participation, we then have voting members which
    are elected. We have two from the impact project. It's up to the project to
    decide how they want to elect those representatives. We also have two which
    represent all of the non-impact projects, although this year, as a
    bootstrap, we accepted everybody who wanted to participate at that level
    into the CPC which is really great because we want to kick off with as many
    people as we can in helping to move things forward. Then we actually can
    have an additional two voting members who are elected from the regular
    members. If we see some people who haven't been elected by an individual
    project but are doing a lot of work and helping to move the CPC work
    forward, they can be elected as voting members Intel. 

    >> Thank you. Coming up on time here. So I just want to go rapid-fire.
    Starting with Myles. If people leave here with one takeaway, from this
    panel, what would you like it to be? 

    >> You don't have to do this alone. 

    >> Oh.  Succinct. I like it! Applause for that! [Applause]. 

    >> So I think I'm really excited to see how we are going to - again, as
    Myles said, there's excitement from the summit this week, prior to JSConf
    EU, excited to seeing these guys saying we are excited, we didn't know there
    is a possibility here. Taking the work we've done in Node and talk to other
    people in the groups in the ecosystem, or in the foundation, to get to work
    together on these things, it's exciting to see the opportunity that we have
    now in JavaScript to be able to work together on this stuff, even from
    helping more on the standards side. 

    >> For me, it's all about new opportunities, and that I see a lot more new
    opportunities for us to collaborate together, to have a greater impact
    across projects, and to achieve bigger things. We have an opportunity to
    achieve things we wouldn't be able to achieve on our own, it's about new
    opportunities across all of the different aspects. 

    >> I have, like, 37 things I would like to share with people, but bearing in
    mind, that we have a minute and a half left, I think the first thing that I
    would like for you all to take away is that there is a lot of opportunity
    for you to give impact and what services the Open JS Foundation provides to
    your projects, and you can follow our work on the Open JS Foundation
    organisation, bootstrap, called the Cross Project Council repo now. If you
    have an idea for something that would be helpful to you as a member of one
    of our projects, or as a potential member of one of our projects, write a
    proposal or open an issue on that, and start following along with our
    meetings and that sort of thing on YouTube and our weekly meetings there. We
    have a great new email list you can start to receiving these weekly emails
    from us that sort of summarises like what is going on, we have JS Foundation
    Slack Channel, so there is a lot of opportunities to start having these
    conversations together, and you can make a difference. You can come, and I
    can't wait to see you there. 

    >> Wonderful, I just want to say I saw a lot of this collaboration between
    projects starting at the most recent collaborators summit which was right
    before this conference. We got people from across the new open JS Foundation
    together. It was historically a Node event but the conversations that
    actually happened in the hallway and in talks are things that I could only
    dream about. We build amazing things on the internet together, we build
    amazing things with JavaScript together, and like Myles put it, we don't
    have to do it alone, and we do it better together. So, definitely go and get
    involved. We are up on GitHub. You can go to the website. Thank you all for
    coming to this panel. [Applause].

The JavaScript ecosystem has been breaking ground in both the Browser and in
the backend with Node.js since JSConfEU launched 10 years ago. We’ve recently
recognized that in the same way that using JavaScript both on the front and
back end unlocks opportunities for more people to contribute to a larger part
of an overall application, combining the JavaScript and Node.js Foundations
allows for easier collaboration and contribution to larger portions of the
JavaScript ecosystem. This panel will cover the key issues, concerns,
discussions, and lessons learned that were part of the effort to bring the
JavaScript and Node.js Foundations together. We’ll also dive into the new
opportunities and exciting future it brings to people and projects across the
JS ecosystem.
