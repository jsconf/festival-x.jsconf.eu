> “This was probably one of the best weekends of my life, meeting great people,
listening to talented developers share their experiences with us and getting
inspired by a lot of them.”

JSConf EU is a professional, not-for-profit, labour-of-love conference for the
JavaScript community. It’s a two day affair, with many related side events in
the days surrounding it. JSConf EU is an invitation for the community to come
together and for new people to get to know and join the community.
