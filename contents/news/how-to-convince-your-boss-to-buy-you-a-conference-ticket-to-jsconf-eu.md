You write JS all day. You are your team’s frontend or Node.js expert (or want
to become one). You are leading a team of engineers, or just starting out as a
junior developer. You are wondering whether to invest in frontend observability
or convert your data layer to GraphQL. You know you have to attend [JSConf EU
2019](https://2019.jsconf.eu/), but how to get your boss to agree to buy you
that ticket?

## Talk business. There’s an ROI in attending a conference.

When you approach your manager to ask for a JSConf EU ticket, know that you are
not the only one who benefits from spending a day watching talks and sipping
free coffee. Companies profit in many ways too – after all, their employees
grow their knowledge, motivation and network!

Companies are usually aware of this, and you might already have a conference
budget in your contract. Maybe your manager actively helps you to grow, and
encourages you to attend events. But not all of us get that support handed on a
silver platter – so know your arguments, and you can convince even the most
skeptical boss.

### Training
* Explain why you want to attend JSConf EU, and what you plan to learn there.
Mention any specific pain points your team might have: slow processes,
knowledge gaps, lack of code quality; and point out how attending JSConf EU
would boost you and your team in tackling these issues.

* Offer to give a lunch talk about the conference and your most important
take-aways, to share your learnings with the team. At the very minimum, plan to
send a quick email to your team with a summary and some links to interesting
tools or techniques you learned about.

* Volunteer to write a blogpost about your experience on the company blog. This
is not only a good way to report back to your team, but it also publicly shows
your company’s involvement and participation in community events.

### Motivation and Inspiration
JSConf EU brings together international experts on frontend, Node.js and
fullstack development, both on stage and within its audience. You get to learn
from them not only during talks, but also during breaks and associated events
(evening gatherings, decompress events). Connecting, chatting and learning from
top-notch talent in the industry can be incredibly inspiring. You’ll find
yourself surrounded by a diverse group of people who work on the exact same
problems you do and you’ll return motivated and eager to apply your new
learnings in your team. What boss wouldn’t love to see some fresh energy?

### Recruitment
Networking is your special skill? Offer to recruit at the event. Your company
is desperately looking for new talent? Great – there’s no better place to meet
skilled designers and frontend developers than JSConf EU. Offer to actively
connect with people and let them know how great working at your company is.

### Promote your product
Your company sells a service or a product that is relevant to web and fullstack
developers? Show some presence at JSConf EU! You can raise awareness for your
brand, get direct feedback from your users, gain some new ones, and show that
your company cares about its community.

## Be prepared for a NO – and don’t give up
You might hear one of the following:

_“We have no budget”_

Don’t give up, and be prepared with the numbers. Calculate what the ticket
would cost, and consider accommodation and travel costs if you need these
covered. Keep in mind that your company can most likely deduct tax from
everything.

Is this investment in your training worth it or not? Ask your boss why they
think that it isn’t.

_“We have no time”_

Perhaps your management thinks that you can’t miss a day in the office, and
that getting stuff done is more important than professional education and
improvement.

Be prepared with some hard facts: Remind them how many hours you wasted on
solving a problem recently. Is your JavaScript code base a mess and hardly
maintainable? Are your designers complaining about super slow implementation of
UI features? What about the animation that would really improve your landing
page, but no one knows how to create it?

The work hours you’ll miss by attending JSConf EU will easily be gained back
later! And it’s on a the weekend anyway (although we do encourage taking days
off in return).

## But I already went to 10 conferences this year
Great! We hope you got to attend some insightful events. Did you make sure to
thank your company for the opportunity, and report back on your learnings? If
you did: Good job! You are helping to build a company culture that values their
employees’ learning and growth. Why not take it one step further? Look around:
Are there people in your team who’d really benefit from attending JSConf EU?
Maybe they are not in a position to ask, or are not experienced in negotiating
like you are. Advocate for them! Point out to your boss that your junior dev or
frontend trainee could really benefit from the experience, or be a mentor to
your coworkers and share some tricks on how to successfully approach your
manager about conference tickets.

## Did you know: sponsors get tickets too
If your personal conference budget is exhausted, maybe your company has a
budget for sponsorships. Did you know all JSConf EU sponsorships include
complimentary tickets to the event? If your direct manager can’t find a budget
for your ticket, maybe your marketing department can. Get them in touch with us
to [talk about sponsoring JSConf EU](/sponsors/).

## I’m my own boss
Congratulations, then you only have to convince yourself! For freelancers, all
of the above reasons apply, too. We’d even argue that a conference like JSConf
EU is the place to meet and connect with new clients, especially on an
international level.

If you are dealing with financial hardships that make a ticket purchase
impossible for you, consider applying to our [Scholarship
program](https://2019.jsconf.eu/scholarships/) - applications are open and
everyone otherwise unable to attend is invited to apply.

We hope those tips are useful and we’re excited to see you at JSConf EU in
June!
