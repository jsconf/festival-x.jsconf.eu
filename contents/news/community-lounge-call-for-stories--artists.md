[Community Lounge](/community-lounge/) is coming back to JSConf & CSSconf
EUâ€¦with a twist! This year, rather than just showcasing leaders of the tech
communities as in the previous years, we are celebrating communities in the way
of storytelling. 

## What are you thankful for in your community?

With the theme of "Gratitude", the Community Lounge is opening its stage to
community members who want to share stories that highlight incredible
experiences within the tech industry and beyond. We will be accepting stories
about communities such as:

- the JSConf and CSSconf family (ex: EU, AR, IS, etc)
- a local tech meetup group (ex: BerlinJS Meetup, Up.Front, Women Tech Makers,
etc)
- a digital community (ex: slack group, forum, etc)
- an open source community
- any other local related community

**Have a story to tell? Still need a ticket to the conferences? Or, you already
have a ticket, but are itching to get on stage? [Tell us your story by May 10
here!](https://goo.gl/forms/Y0T0p8snRoKa0qPA3)**

### Are you a new media artist?
We are also inviting artists to create interactive pieces that fit the theme of
gratitude and community. **[We'd love to hear your
ideas!](https://goo.gl/forms/W6EcIHYA1QwHCIz33)**
