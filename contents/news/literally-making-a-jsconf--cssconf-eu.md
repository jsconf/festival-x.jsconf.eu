Have you ever wondered how we transform the empty [Arena
Berlin](https://www.arena.berlin/en/location/arena-halle/) into the sprawling
JSConf & [CSSconf EU](https://2019.cssconf.eu/) event experiences? Wonder no
more, because here is the full timelapse!

This is what is going on:

- 0:00 Arena Berlin is just one big empty hall. First trucks and forklifts are
present to start the construction.
- 0:01 Stage construction begins and the [Mozilla
Arch](https://experiencethearch.mozilla.org/) is being assembled.
- 0:03 Scaffolding behind stage is being assembled.
- 0:08 [Mozilla Arch](https://experiencethearch.mozilla.org/) is going
vertical.
- 0:10 Scaffolding for back wall of main auditorium (Closer to camera than
stage) is standing. Construction of sponsor area scaffolding separators is
starting.
- 0:18 The video is getting busier because more of the sponsor area close to
the camera is coming together.
- 0:21 Square canvases are added to fill out some of the scaffolding.
- 0:24 Stage lighting setup starts
- 0:29 Projector setup is starting
- 0:30 Holiday-style lights are hung and turned on
- 0:31 Full stage light setup is tested
- 0:35 Switch to CSSconf.eu color scheme

Events can seem very abstract or like they are always there. We hope this
provides some insights as to what is really going on behind the scenes. For an
impression of what the events themselves are like, [check out this
video](/news/impressions-of-jsconf-eu-2018/).
