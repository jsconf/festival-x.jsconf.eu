### When is the conference?

JSConf EU happens on June 1st and 2nd, 2019. [CSSconf
EU](https://2019.cssconf.eu/), its sister conference, happens on May 31st,
2019.

### What is the conference venue address, how do I get there?

The venue address is:

_Eichenstraße 4_

_12435 Berlin_

You can get there via multiple transport options:

* __Via Taxi__: In Berlin, you can use the _mytaxi_ app, which also supports
app payments.
* __Via Public Transport__: The bus stop closest to the venue is
Eichenstraße/Puschkinallee. Take the 165 or 265 bus there. You can also get
there via a short walk from the S-Bahn station Treptower Park, which is
serviced by many different lines. The closest U-Bahn stop is Schlesisches Tor
on the U1 line, from which you can take the 165/265 bus lines mentioned above.
* __Via Bike__: The venue is reachable via bike. There are bike stands outside,
although they might be full.
* __Via Car__: There are no venue-specific parking spots, but the venue itself
is reachable by car.

More info on [transport and travel](/news/travel-hotels-and-transport/).

### In case of a medical emergency, what do I do?

Please alert first aid staff as soon as possible. They can be found in the
first aid tent in the outdoors area, marked by a white cross on a green
background. If you do not know where that is, please ask the security staff or
awareness team that’s present everywhere around the venue.

For convenience, the location of the first aid tent has been marked in this
picture:

### What does the “Sit” and “Sit and stand” mean in front of the restrooms?

We do not have gendered bathrooms, instead opting for a unisex approach. The
“Sit and stand” refers to there being both urinals and regular toilets. “Stand”
means there’s only regular toilets.

### What language are the talks in?

All conference talks are given in English. In rare cases, talks may be given in
a different language and live-translated into English.

### When does the venue open?

The venue opens at 8AM local time on both days. Breakfast starts at 8:30AM.

### What does “pronoun” mean when I buy a ticket?

Instead of only printing your name and optionally your company name on your
badge, this year we will be printing your pronouns on it as well. Pronouns are
the words people use to refer to you in place of your name, such as “he”, “she”
or “they” (yes, a singular they). In the past years, we’ve given out pronoun
pins that you could wear, but we’ve decided to make it an option for everybody
this year. If you have further questions, please email contact@jsconf.eu!

### What is a support person? 
In case you are invited to CSSconf and/or JSConf EU in any role (speaker,
scholarship holder, MC, artist), you are asked, if you need a support person to
attend the event either for support during travel and/or during the whole
event. If needed and you can’t afford to cover the extra costs for a support
person, we are happy to cover the costs for you and help with travel,
accommodation and a ticket to the conference(s).

_A support person is necessary to protect the health and safety of the person
with impairments/disabilities during the travel and/or events._

The role of a support person is for example: 
* Sign Language interpretation* Prompting or giving advice, including
requesting a break if needed* Providing physical support during travel and/or
the event* Providing emotional support and reassurance during travel and/or
the event

### How can I get an invitation letter for my visa?

In order to obtain a visa invitation letter from us, please fill out [this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn4wzs4AQguzj9TLFQgK0ly_W0D2oMWL6BsyccQwLqYHhQlg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
This might take some time, so if your country has specific time restrictions on
visas, please let us know beforehand.

### Do you recommend a hotel?

Here’s two hotels we recommend, both a short walk away from the venue:

* [Holiday Inn (20min
walk)](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/berlin/berow/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-HI-_-DE-_-BEROW)
* [Michelberger Hotel (20min walk)](http://michelbergerhotel.com/en/)

Other than that, Berlin has a _lot_ of hotels, and even if your hotel isn’t
close to the venue, Berlin has a good public transport network, so it’s likely
you’ll have no trouble at all getting to the conference.

### Is there food for my diet?

Our catering service will provide food options for most diets. If you have a
specific diet, feel free to contact us at contact@jsconf.eu.

### Can I be a volunteer?

While our volunteer team is currently complete, we might have very few slots
open closer to the event, in which case we will post about them on social
media.

### Are there student tickets?

We do not offer student tickets or discounts, but you can still apply for a
[scholarship](https://2019.jsconf.eu/scholarships/).

### I want to sponsor, how?

We’d be happy to have you! You can find more information about sponsoring the
conference on our [sponsors page](https://2019.jsconf.eu/sponsors/).

### I want to give a talk, how? 

Unfortunately, our Call for Papers has ended since December 31st, 2018.

### How do I get my badge to enter the conference?

When doors open at 8:00AM at the venue. There might be different queues based
on the __first name of the attendee__. Additionally, there might be a
pre-conference event the day before where you can pick up your badge early.
This page will be updated with more information as the conference draws
closer.

### Will there be photos taken of me?

When getting your badge, you will have the choice between two types of
lanyards:

* __Black Lanyard__: This signals our photographer that you’re okay with being
in pictures.
* __Red Lanyard__: This signals our photographer that you would prefer not to
be in pictures.

Before publishing our official event photos, we double-check and remove any
photos that show identifiable people with red lanyards. We would also like to
ask attendees not to take and publish pictures that have other attendees with
red lanyards in them. 

Please note that there might be large group photo opportunities (the “family
photo”). If you do not wish to be in this photo, please don’t join the group
photo. 

### Do you have a newsletter or something of the sort?

We do, and you can [sign up for it](https://2019.jsconf.eu/newsletter/) to get
news about the conferences roughly twice a month!

### Do you have a Code of Conduct?

We have and enforce a [code of
conduct](https://2019.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct/).
### Do you have a quiet room?
We will provide a clearly signposted quiet room during the conference. More
information will be added as the conference comes closer.

### Do you offer childcare?

We do! We’ll release more information about this soon.

### Ticket sales are currently closed, when is the next sale?

schedule](https://2019.jsconf.eu/news/ticket-sale-schedule/).

Yes, over at https://youtube.com/jsconfeu.

### I have accessibility concerns, can you help me?

Yes! Head over to our [accessibility statement.](/accessibility/)

### I need a proper invoice, what do I do?

Our ticketing system issues proper invoices and you can edit all the detail,
even after you have bought the ticket through a link in the confirmation
email.

### What is the deal with VAT?

tl;dr - we are obliged to charge VAT for every ticket we sell, for everybody
and even every company. Longer explanation found here: https://ti.to/docs/vat

### Can I reassign a ticket?

Yes! You received emails for your original purchase that contain links that
allow you to assign tickets to any person of your choosing.
