We are excited to announce our special diversity sponsor Glitch, who will
support our Scholarship Program by enabling more than 10 people to join JSConf
EU and CSSconf EU from underrepresented communities in tech.

This will help to enable even more people to attend two important European
developer conferences and share, learn and grow through their experiences and
interactions with the community.It is a large step towards further developing
one of the biggest community Scholarship Programs in the tech community, and we
thank Glitch for their beyond generous support.

Glitch is the friendly community where everyone can discover and create the
best stuff on the web. With working example apps to remix, a code editor to
modify them, instant hosting and deployment â€” anybody can build a web app on
Glitch, for free.
