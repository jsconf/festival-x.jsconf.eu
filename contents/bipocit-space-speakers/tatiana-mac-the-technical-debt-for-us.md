Many if not all of us have been "the only one" in boardrooms, design reviews,
diversity and inclusion discussions. Our isolation from people who look like us
with similar lived experiences often forces us into roles where we speak on
behalf of and advocate for the whole.

While honourable and sometimes necessary for self and community preservation,
repeatedly playing this role can incur a psychological and career debt: it
spends our resources in ways we don't choose.

Through this talk, we'll seek the balance between our moral imperatives to
society, improvement of our environments, and our care to ourselves. We will
celebrate the forgiveness for our past and future choices, recognising that the
choices we make are never easy.
