JSConf EU is known for its elaborate stage design with lots of vivid
animations, flashing lights and loud music. In previous years we’ve heard that
this can be too much for some folks–especially over sustained periods of time.
For this reason we’ve decided to provide a dedicated “quiet room” that allows
y’all to step away from the sensory exposure of the conference.

In related news, [the animated X on the our homepage](/) now does not animate
when users have expressed in their accessibility settings that they prefer
reduced motion. This is based on the new
[prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
media query.
