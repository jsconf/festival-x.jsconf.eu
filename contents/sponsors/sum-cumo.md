We are a strongly growing, innovative digital company from Hamburg founded in
2010 and have since grown to about 140 employees with offices in Hamburg,
Dusseldorf and Zurich.

Digitalization means more than just using new technologies. Today, companies
that consistently think and act digitally are the most successful in the world.
This is where we come in.

We support and guide companies in the insurance and lottery industries as they
strike out in new directions: learning to understand their own customers
better. Refining their brands. Opening up new distribution channels and
technologically orienting themselves around the most modern players in the
market – or even setting new standards themselves. 

The engine of our success are the people at sum.cumo – a bunch of very creative
and passionate enthusiasts in the areas of digital consulting, ux, marketing
and of course developer, who love trying out new things and are striving for
approaches that successfully establish real, disruptive innovations.

Since 2010, we have grown rapidly. Very rapidly. That is why we are looking
(amongst others) for developer (which make the majority of our employees) in
our Hamburg and Dusseldorf offices to help us continuously create, develop and
improve our cool applications.

So if you think, feel and work digitally, love to develop bleeding edge
frontends and love to work in agile, interdisciplinary teams – you might be the
right person for us. We are looking for new colleagues who are looking for
exciting and complex projects and do not want to write average code.
