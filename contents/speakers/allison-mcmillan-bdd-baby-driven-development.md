    I never expected having a child to change my identity in so many different
    ways. You see, I love working. I really love working, and I love being a
    developer, I love being an engineering manager. I love solving hard problems
    every day. And I've always worn a lot of hats. I work at GitHub as the
    engineering manager as well for another team that is working on a secret
    product, re-imagining fun and collaboration in code. I'm also a Mozilla tech
    speaker, on the word of Ruby Together, and I run a podcast about
    parent-driven development. I have stickers for all of these things. If you
    want to chat about any of them, please come and find me. I've been a
    community organiser, a mentor, a developer, an organiser, a COO, and then,
    all of a sudden, I was a mom. So this is Devon. He was important in April
    2015. This talk is going to have a lot of pictures of him. Devon's a
    full-blown toddler now and joined by his sister, Layla who is just over a
    year. Today, I want to talk about the challenges people who are parents and
    developers face, as well as what some solutions are, and how these solutions
    can help a company and an entire team. So, when Devon was about five months
    old, I felt like I was losing my mind. I had been back at work full-time for
    a while - if you want to hear a separate rant, talk to me about maternity
    leave in the States - and after a particularly bad week of very little sleep
    at night, and having a really challenging workweek, I just really wasn't
    sure if I could do it. How was I going to keep learning all the things I
    needed to be learning while being a great mom, employee, and adequate
    partner? How did did others do it? Was I being unrealistic? Was I being
    lazy. Could I even be a good mom and a developer or was this industry just
    truly not for me? If I've being really honest, there's been many times in
    the past four years where even though I loved tech and I loved code, I
    thought about how nice it would be just to go and do a job that I could do
    on autopilot. I seriously thought about leaving the industry. You see these
    cute pictures of parents orchids on Facebook or Instagram, but it's not
    always like that, and, for me, in the early days, it definitely usually
    wasn't like that. It has hard, tiring, frustrating. It was also amazing, and
    all-encompassing. It was really, really lonely. Based on what I was
    experiencing, I created a survey to ask parents a few questions about this
    issue, and what I found out from reading hundreds of surveys, is there are
    some real trends and common issues. In an industry, the values - in a
    industry that voles open-source contributions, parents are struggling. So
    let me take a second to describe a typical day from a few months ago. So
    Devon wakes up around seven, Layla already around 730. A lot of parents say
    it's closer to 5.30 or six. I would nurse Layla while Devon has a glass of
    milk and by 8.15, we really need to get moving, brush teeth, make car
    breakfasts - you can feel free to judge. We're not morning people, car
    breakfast is what works very well for us. And at 8.45 or nanny comes which
    is already a huge privilege. By nine I drop Devon off at preschool. By 9.25
    I was home pumping breast milk while eat breakfast and starting to check
    emails. I would jump into the work day, do that punctuated by a few more
    breast-milk pumping breaks until about 5.15. Then I race out the door, grab
    Layla, put her in the car, from 6.15 to 7.15, we do dinner for the kids,
    sometimes try to cook our dinner, Bath time, bed tile, et cetera. From .45
    until around nine, we finish cooking, we eat dinner, clean up, prep food in
    bottles for the next day, jot down childcare notes, talk about pertinent
    household stuff we need to, usually relax for like 30 minutes, and then we
    head to bed. We have it pretty good, even with two. Now, fortunately, this
    was a day from a couple of months ago. I got a lot more time back in my day
    as I weaned my daughter and didn't need to pump breast milk. Dropping the
    number of times that I had to pump in a day felt amazing. I had more time to
    concentrate and didn't have to go through this huge context-switch every two
    hours. And I mention this tangent because pumping breast milk was mentioned
    in over half of surveys for mothers and their answer is about company
    provision or issues they faced. Now, the only time in that whole day that I
    would have to do any code for myself would be those last 30 minutes that I
    have to relax, and even if I gave up that little bit of self-care time, my
    brain is so tired by then, I wouldn't get anywhere fast. And if you think
    about this in terms of code challenges that often need to be completed
    outside of your work day for new jobs, parents may have to spend the whole
    weekend just working on a couple of code challenges. It also means depending
    on our partner or spouse to do the childcare and not seeing your kids. This
    might not seem like a big deal, but when you're already working full-time,
    it really is. This is even more challenging if you're a single parent. If
    you're a accessible parent, then you're likely paying for weekend childcare
    to get these code challenges done. Another issue mentioned was being able to
    stay sharp. Developers live on coffee and solve really hard problems. If you
    are a nursing mom, you're probably getting significantly less sleep, and you
    can't rely on those cups of coffee to keep you going. A recent study from
    baby care found that over 40 per cent of parents with babies aged zero to
    six months only get one to three uninterrupted hours of sleep per night.
    Parents lose a total of 44 days of sleep in their child's first year, and a
    newer study found that parents are sleep-deprived for six years after they
    have a kid, and I'm like really selling this parenting thing right now! It's
    hard to keep a clear mind and solve hard problems when you're not getting
    uninterrupted sleep, and you don't get the weekend to catch up or recharge.
    A parent wrote, "Sometimes, the last thing I want to do or even have time to
    do when I get home is code or learn new code. Gone are the days of no
    responsibility and doing whatever I like when I get home. Finding a couple
    of hours to work on a personal project or pick up something new is hard,
    especially when trying to help out my other half who is also tired." When I
    asked if having children helped or hurt their career, only a small portion
    of fathers said it hurt their career. They felt it either helped or had a
    future impact. About 60 per cent of women said that having children hurt
    their career, but even more than that, said it didn't hurt their career, but
    it changed it. Many women said it slowed their career, affecting the overall
    trajectory and growth potential. Now, I don't know about you, but that
    description certainly sounds like hurt ing mothers clearest to me. So here's
    the total breakdown of parents based on if they felt that having a child
    helped, hurt, or had no impact, or helped and hurt their career. Here are
    those same traces based on mom answers and bad answers. As you can see, when
    everyone is together, the portions are equal. As you break it down, it tells
    a much different story. This data is backed up by additional research. This
    2018 study on children and gender and equality in Denmark shows these
    results based on gender and earnings in Denmark, which I know at least for
    most Americans consider closer to the gold standard in terms of supporting
    parents. So while there are lots of challenges that parents face, there are
    also lots of solutions. Looking at these surveys, they're identifiable
    solutions that companies can put in place, solutions that colleagues with or
    without children can employ, and things that parents out there can also work
    on. These solutions can actually benefit an entire team. The company- based
    ones: allow working from home or unconventional working options. Even when a
    parent is ready to come back to work, offering different options can make
    huge difference in their happiness level. For women who are pumping, being
    able to work from home makes an enormous difference. When I worked from
    home, I could pump in 22 minutes because I had everything set up, and ready
    to go, but any time that I went into an office, it took me 32 to 34 minutes
    each time, because I had to set up, clean up, and the travel time to get to
    the room, hope nobody's in the room, et cetera. Hopefully, this isn't as
    much of an issue in Europe or outside of the States but I wanted to mention
    it again, because over half of surveys from women suggested that issues are
    difficulties around pumping pup if you have women at your company that are
    pumping in their bathroom, your company needs to seriously consider how they
    prioritise mothers in the workforce. Allowing working from home takes the
    stress of a commute out of the equation, and allows parents a little more
    flexibility and time in their day. Another option is to offer a part-time
    transition back to work, so surveys show that people took this in different
    ways, some working less hours, some working less days, but a gradual
    transition back to work for pretty much as long as the company can allow it
    makes an enormous difference in a parent's lifestyle. Second, companies can
    take a much more proactive role in creating support systems. So a really
    simple example of this might be a parenting Slack channel where parents can
    share experiences, issues, and pictures of their kids. And a more involved
    option might be to connect parents returning to work with those who have
    taken parental leave in the past and allow for it to be a safe space pour
    both parties to  discuss - for both parties to discuss successes, issues,
    and challenges. Finally, train managers on what to expect when someone on
    parental leave comes back to work. This is important for moms do dads but
    moms?  In particular. Oftentimes, managers in tech may never have had a
    mother go on maternity leave for their team. They have no idea what
    challenges she is facing, what questions might help or hurt her return back
    to work transition, and how best to support her. Over and over again, I felt
    my boss was a big part of my success when I was a new parent. Third, create
    realistic expectations returning to work. If your company operates out of
    KPIs, or goal-setting, recognise these should be revisited when parents come
    back to work, and set new goals. These will likely not be as ambitious as
    they did in the past. If you're a manager, encourage realistic goal-setting,
    and, if you're an employee, recognise that your whole life has changed. Give
    yourself a least a quarter or two to adjust to the new normal. As your
    children get older, you will become what effective goal-setting and
    realistic expectations look like for you. Fourth, if you have children or if
    you don't have children or for the majority of your team is childless, don't
    make parent stuff weird. Talk about nursing, kid things, in whatever ways
    feel comfortable. One of the things that I did when I was back in the office
    after my first was create an emoji for when I was away from my computer
    pumping. This helped me feel open and honest about what was going on, and it
    did so in a way that didn't make my team feel awkward or weird about it.
    After my second, I just stuck my pumping times right on my calendar so folks
    didn't schedule meetings over them. My previous company, I did a lightning
    talk for the engineering team. I did two while I was pregnant, about what
    that was like, and one afterwards about the science of breast milk and
    pumping. My team asked interesting questions and had much more empathy and
    understanding for me afterwards, and my hope is by exposing them to some of
    the terminology and experiences that there will be more understanding and
    empathic to women or parents they might work with in the future. But, this
    should not be incumbent on the pregnant individual to do so. Managers should
    have an understanding of these facts, and also be willing to be the one that
    helps their team understand these considerations. That's realistic
    expectations and normalising it. When creative options, realistic
    expectations, support systems, and normalisation of someone's life choices
    are incorporated into a team or company's culture, it is positive, it has
    positive benefits for the entire company. The open acceptance of diversity
    and intentional support around the uniqueness of a team-mate's life creates
    that sort of in a team. As they are trained to establish and seek out things
    like support systems, or create realistic expectations, anyone going through
    any sort of hardship or life adjustment will feel supported. Once you've
    created these systems and benefits, it's easier to see how similar
    accommodations for others enable teams to thrive. Support systems could help
    folks from burning out, and normalise being open about struggles and
    successes makes it more likely that someone who is burning out will speak up
    earlier. Realistic expectations encourage teams to craft better guidelines
    around work and promotion which often help under-represented minorities
    succeed. And creative working options help companies attract the best talent
    regardless of where they reside. There are also things that we can do as
    parents. First, get rid of your parent guilt, which is so much easier said
    than done. So I'm going to tell you a story about Hallowe'en. My son was a
    baby, six months old, I made two Hallowe'en costumes for him, and there's
    been so many home-made does actuals since then. The picture of both my
    children, those are the costumes I frantically finished sewing eight yours
    before I had to fly to Malaysia. Why? Because, for me, I feel spending this
    time after the kids have gone to bed, making their costumes, of course,
    that's the reason why my kids feel like they're my top priority, right? No,
    that's ridiculous statement. I know it's a ridiculous statement, it's a
    ridiculous statement to say, but oftentimes working parents feel this way.
    We feel bad and like we are ordering too much take-out, or we miss a special
    activity, but we also need to realise that working and doing something that
    we love is just as important for us and for our children to see. A mom said,
    "I thought I was a bad mother and developer because I didn't make everything
    perfect." Next schedule, it took me about a year to do this, but the first
    time I took a random day off, where my son was in childcare, my husband was
    at work, and I didn't pack my day filled with catch-up work or household
    chores. I felt so refreshed. We don't get the weekends to recharge, and
    vacations are really not vacations once you have had a child. So it's
    important to not put these days off, and to make sure that you're taking at
    least one every couple of months just to recharge. Next, optimise the time
    that you have available. So as I mentioned before, a lot of surveys talk
    about being really aware of the finite amount of time that parents had do
    work, so make sure that you're making the most of these hours. Set learning
    goals, focus and figure out how to hack your day to create as much time as
    possible to add advance whatever goals you're putting forward for yourself.
    Next, we can only make this better if we are united. So, it wasn't until I
    truly felt like I was teeth ing under the stress that I reached out to other
    mum developers. It wasn't until I reached out that I learned that lots of
    people felt the same way that I did. I found some excellent communities of
    moms in tech, and it's made a huge difference. Being able to speak with one
    another, and share challenges, solutions, and suggestions, is invaluable.
    Just lying having a support group, when you have a newborn supporting one
    another as parents in tech makes us stronger, and better, and gives us a
    more united voice. Next: share that mental load. So I'm going to talk about
    moms for a moment, because mothers are disproportionately affected by the
    weight of mental load, although this happens in most partnerships. In 2015,
    the Pugh Research Centre interviewed 1,800 parents in households where they
    both work. They asked who does the work of managing your children's
    schedules and activities? Who takes care of the kids when they're sick?
    Marie Kondo's series was a prime example of women being crushed by
    responsibilities. The number of moms who I talked to who told me they sat on
    the couch and cried while watching that show because they felt the same way
    was truly incredible. The New York Times had an article in February about
    working mothers in Japan, and it spoke about how working mothers often work
    more than 49 hours a week and typically do close to 25 hours of housework a
    week, while their partners do an average of less than five. So let's say you
    have a partner, and let's say your partner's great which which I have found
    is a big assumption, and let's say that you feel like you've got a good
    split of work. You share pick-ups and drop offs, you share cooking,
    cleaning, et cetera. But what about the other stuff? So, who thinks about
    what the kids are going to eat for lunch? Who schedules doctor's
    appointments? Who knows what day school will be loafed? Who knows what child
    needs next developmentally and what is coming after that? Who buys the
    birthday presents? Who reviews homework? Who plans and packs for family
    trips? If you're already splitting this load, then I applaud you, but for
    many families, this isn't the case, so if you're not doing it already, share
    that load. I will rink to a worksheet that can jump start this conversation.
    I put a checklist on the door on who needs what in order to leave the house
    in the morning. I realised that I was taking on the mental burden of having
    to make sure that everybody was ready in the morning, even on the days that
    my husband was doing drop-off. With this list, we can both make sure that
    everyone has everything they need without me needing to be the one that
    bears that burden. Finally, if you need to leave your company, leave your
    company. Ultimately, if your company doesn't understand the lifestyle of you
    as a parent and doesn't allow you to be with your children when you need to
    be, then, if you can, try to leave. This advice came up over and over again
    in surveys, although admittedly, a lot has been filled out by senior-level
    developers. So I that is disappear self-parent guilt, self-care days, find a
    community, share the mental load and leave if you have to. For your teams,
    remember just existing as a parent on your team makes your teams better.
    You're organised, you need to set boundaries, and you must have some sort of
    work-life balance. Being this role model helps everyone, even if they don't
    know that you're role-modelling it. A little while ago, my team had an os
    site that I brought my family to. In order for me to be available for dinner
    and bedtime each evening, my day ended up at five and we didn't meet until
    7.30. My team brought this about not knowing I had created that break
    because I needed to balance running the offsite with being present for my
    family. When I told them the reason why the break existed, they saw that not
    only did that benefit me and my family but it also benefitted them by giving
    them a chance to recharge before evening activities. Finally, we're going to
    talk about what colleagues can do because colleagues with or without
    children have lots of power to make things better for team-mates and make
    companies better in general. First, ask about lactation rooms. If you live
    in a country where moms are still pumping when they return to work. I was at
    a conference once in America, and I needed a place to pump, and I asked the
    front desk person if there was a space other than the bathroom to do so. He
    said, "I think we have a supply closet somewhere that you can use."
    Fortunately, there was a security guard standing nearby who walked over and
    said my wife's going through the same thing, I'm sure we can do better than
    a bathroom or supply closet, and let me look around for you quickly, and
    sure enough, they found me an empty office. Mothers should not be alone in
    this fight. If you're company is moving into a new space or spending money
    building something out, suggest they make appropriate accommodations for
    mothers returning to work, and if they don't know what those are, there are
    plenty of women who would be happy to talk to them about it. Second, just be
    friendly. This one is easy, but when folks are coming back, ask what they're
    doing. Coming back to work can be emotional, check in, show them that you
    care, and appreciated, and supported really makes a difference. Third, make
    your voice heard. Someone suggests working late, or schedule late meetings,
    see someone criticising a parent for needing to take time because their
    child is sick or has a doctor's appointment, parents often feel really
    guilty about taking this time, or saying, "I have to go, I have to run to
    pick up my chilled." It's helpful for others on the team to speak up as well
    and say I know this meeting is running over, we want to be respectful of
    those with the hard stuff. Or is there any chance we can schedule this
    meeting earlier? I know it doesn't work for everyone's schedule. Finally, if
    someone uses a word or concept that you don't know, Google it. I like to
    think that most of us are pretty good at Google. We generally like learning
    new things, so if you don't know what pumping is, curious about childcare
    costs, never heard of a sleep progression or anything that the parent
    mentions on your team, Google it. There are great resources out there to
    learn more. That summary is lactation rooms, be nice, speak up, and use
    Google. While there are specific things that colleagues can do to help
    parents, these actions benefit everyone and make teams stronger. These
    suggestions boil down to increasing empathy and curiosity, and an interest
    in your colleagues and their lives, as well as a desire to understand one
    another. When these factors are incorporated into a team's DNA, it leads to
    stronger, more effective teams that can support and understand one another
    more effectively. You may ask about lactation rooms specifically to support
    parents on your team, but you're also learning to recognise difference
    situations where different accommodations are helpful. You're learning how
    to support team-mates by asking questions and figuring out how to be a
    better ally on your team, and teams that are strong in these areas help
    attract and remain more diverse talent. There are some great resources out
    there. You can take a look at how your company is doing, or how companies
    you're looking at are doing. The number-one piece of advice that I got on
    surveys was that you will never get this time with your children back. So
    value it, prioritise it, and try to guard it as much as possible. There are
    some days that I still feel like I'm not sure I can be a successful mom and
    in tech, but there are some days that I can give 100 per cent to both areas,
    and others where I feel like I'm letting my family or my job down.
    Oftentimes, though, I find myself calling on developer or manager strategies
    for effective parenting where or vice versa. I personally think this makes
    me a better manager and gives me more experiences and strategies I can call
    upon in a variety of situations. What I also learned through speaking with
    parents and people in the amazing parents that answered a few questions, is
    that the struggle that I face are not unique. It's important for all of us
    as a community, as developers, as colleagues, as peers, and managers to
    think about this. I thought that everything that I was feeling was just me,
    but it's everyone. Everyone has similar concerns, and a lot of people have
    the same issues. So let's think about how we can make it better, because
    they're solvable. Peers with or without children, managers, directors of
    engineering, we can make the lives of the parents in tech better which will
    ultimately make our teams and companies better. This research is ongoing, so
    feel free to check out my Twitter if you want to fill it out, and, parents,
    as one person wrote on their survey, just high-fives. You're awesome! Be
    confident! Thank you. [Applause].

      When I became a parent, I was completely unprepared for the challenges
      that awaited me. I reached out to hundreds of fellow parents in tech and
      learned there are common challenges that simply aren’t spoken about. These
      focus around one fact that no one wants to admit… parenting is not fun.
      Parenting is stressful, difficult, and oftentimes incredibly lonely. But
      being a parent also makes people more organized, focused, and empathetic.
      We’ll explore these survey results to expose common trends and issues and
      discuss solutions that show how supporting parents helps all team members
      thrive.
