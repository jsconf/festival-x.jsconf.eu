Ubilabs is the specialist for interactive map applications with offices in
Hamburg, Munich, and San Francisco. In our team of 40 developers, project
managers, and designers, we bring projects to life for international customers
such as Google, National Geographic, and Daimler. A lot has changed since we
were first established as a team of four in 2007. But one thing has remained
the same: the enthusiasm from our first years as a start-up and the belief that
we can create great value for our customers by combining technical innovation
and design. We view ourselves as service providers, as a lab for new ideas, as
implementers, as consultants, and as designers. We act as a reliable partner
for our customers and make sure that our work reflects the strengths of their
brand.
