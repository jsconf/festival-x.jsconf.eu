We can't wait to welcome you all at Arena Berlin in just over 2 weeks. To

event! For the second year running, all dishes are vegetarian, with plenty of
vegan options available as well.

## BREAKFAST

- Scrambled eggs, with either herbs, tomatoes, goat cheese or baby spinach
- Various kinds of cheese or cream cheese with grapes
- Fruit yogurt or natural yogurt
- Fruit salad and fruits
- Bircher muesli and natural muesli
- Marmalade specialties: Strawberry vanilla, cherry chocolate & apricot
- Pancakes with maple syrup fresh from the oven
