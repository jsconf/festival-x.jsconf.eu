Just before the new year the JSConf EU Call for Speakers ended, and we’re
overwhelmed by the sheer number and quality of the submissions! We’re currently
sifting through **a record 928 talk proposals** and want to thank all of you
who have participated!

Our review process starts with an anonymized stage in which our review panel
grades every submission based on the title and description of the talk only.
While we have evolved the process since 2012, you can [read about it in more
detail
here](https://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/09/17/beating-the-odds-how-we-got-25-percent-women-speakers.html).

However, we collect some additional demographic information and thought it may
be helpful to share the data with the rest of the community to give insights
into the population of potential speakers for tech conferences in 2019.

Please note, that all this data is **self reported** and is based on free form
text fields rather than a fixed set of options. For better comprehensibility we
have manually edited some of the data (Such as aligning case “women” -> “Women”
or singular/plural “Woman” -> “Women”).

Please note, that these data points represented the **unreviewed submission
data**. Our observation from previous years is that proposals from
underrepresented people in tech tend to skew higher in review score, so the
distribution for speakers will likely look quite different.

Unless otherwise noted the “Percent” data represents the percent of unique
submitters (as measured by unique email addresses) while the count represents
the raw count of submissions (one person may submit multiple talks).

# Gender Distribution

|----------------------------|---------|-------|
| Male                       | 72.47%  | 643   |
| Female                     | 19.52%  | 177   |

| Male/Female (2 speakers)   | 0.76%   | 8     |
| Non-binary                 | 0.76%   | 6     |
| Non-binary woman           | 0.45%   | 3     |

While we are clearly far away from a gender representation in our talk
submission pool that would reflect the world outside of tech, we are beyond
excited about the absolute numbers — with the count of non-male speaker
candidates widely exceeding the total number of submissions we had just a few
years ago.

The plurality of submissions for a conference in Berlin, Germany is coming from
the USA — clearly showing the uneven distribution of tech between Europe and
the US. India coming out on top of all European countries except Germany
represents a new trend for our event.

We are proud however, of the overall number of different countries represented,
as we’re hoping to provide as good of a global perspective on JavaScript as we
possibly can.

# Summary

We hope this data is helpful in setting a baseline as to what can be expected
in terms of distribution of speakers along various axes. Especially we want to
note that the scale of the JavaScript community is now such that absolute
numbers easily allow for equal representation of underrepresented groups in
tech within smaller groups such as the “selected speakers at an event”.

Excuses such as “There are no women speakers” are now proven to be invalid
(they never were valid in the first place). However, events shouldn’t expect
similar numbers if they don’t invest in encouraging speakers from
underrepresented groups to submit talks to their events. We realize this is
extra work beyond just opening a call for speakers with open submissions, but
we believe it is absolutely essential for running a technology event today.
